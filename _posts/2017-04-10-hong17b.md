title: Regression Uncertainty on the Grassmannian
abstract: Trends in longitudinal or cross-sectional studies over time are often captured
  through regression models. In their simplest manifestation, these regression models
  are formulated in $R^n$. However, in the context of imaging studies, the objects
  of interest which are to be regressed are frequently best modeled as elements of
  a Riemannian manifold. Regression on such spaces can be accomplished through geodesic
  regression. This paper develops an approach to compute confidence intervals for
  geodesic regression models. The approach is general, but illustrated and specifically
  developed for the Grassmann manifold, which allows us, e.g., to regress shapes or
  linear dynamical systems. Extensions to other manifolds can be obtained in a similar
  manner. We demonstrate our approach for regression with 2D/3D shapes using synthetic
  and real data.
