title: Compressed Least Squares Regression revisited
abstract: We revisit compressed least squares (CLS) regression as originally analyzed
  in Maillard and Munos (2009) and later on in Kaban (2014) with some refinements.
  Given a set of high-dimensional inputs, CLS applies a random projection and then
  performs least squares regression based on the projected inputs of lower dimension.
  This approach can be beneficial with regard to both computation (yielding a smaller
  least squares problem) and statistical performance (reducing the estimation error).
  We will argue below that the outcome of previous analysis of the procedure is not
  meaningful in typical situations, yielding a bound on the prediction error that
  is inferior to ordinary least squares while requiring the dimension of the projected
  data to be of the same order as the original dimension. As a fix, we subsequently
  present a modified analysis with meaningful implications that much better reflects
  empirical results with simulated and real data.
