title: On the learnability of fully-connected neural networks
abstract: Despite the empirical success of deep neural networks, there is limited
  theoretical understanding on the learnability of these models using a polynomial-time
  algorithm. In this paper, we characterize the learnability of fully-connected neural
  networks via both positive and negative results. We focus on $\ell_1$-regularized
  networks, where the $\ell_1$-norm of the incoming weights of every neuron is assumed
  to be bounded by a constant $B > 0$. Our first result shows that such networks are
  properly learnable in $\text{poly}(n,d,\exp(1/ε^2))$ time, where $n$ and $d$ are the sample
  size and the input dimension, and $ε> 0$ is the gap to optimality. The bound is
  achieved by repeatedly sampling over a low-dimensional manifold so as to ensure
  approximate optimality, but avoids the $\exp(d)$ cost of exhaustively searching
  over the parameter space. We also establish a hardness result showing that the exponential
  dependence on $1/ε$ is unavoidable unless $\bf RP = \bf NP$.  Our second result
  shows that the exponential dependence on $1/ε$ can be avoided by exploiting the
  underlying structure of the data distribution. In particular, if the positive and
  negative examples can be separated with margin $γ> 0$ by an unknown neural network,
  then the network can be learned in $\text{poly}(n,d,1/ε)$ time. The bound is achieved by
  an ensemble method which uses the first algorithm as a weak learner. We further
  show that the separability assumption can be weakened to tolerate noisy labels.
  Finally, we show that the exponential dependence on $1/γ$ is unimprovable under
  a certain cryptographic assumption.
