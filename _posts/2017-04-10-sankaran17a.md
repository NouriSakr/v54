title: Identifying Groups of Strongly Correlated Variables through Smoothed Ordered
  Weighted $L_1$-norms
abstract: The failure of LASSO   to identify groups of correlated predictors in linear  regression  has
  sparked significant research interest. Recently,   various norms were proposed,
  which can be  best described as instances of ordered weighted $\ell_1$ norms (OWL),
  as an alternative to $\ell_1$ regularization used in LASSO. OWL can identify groups
  of correlated variables but  it forces the model to be constant within a group.  This
  artifact induces unnecessary bias in the model estimation.  In this paper we take
  a submodular perspective and show that  OWL can be posed as the Lov√°sz extension
  of a suitably defined submodular function. The submodular perspective not only explains
  the group-wise constant behavior of OWL, but also suggests alternatives. The main
  contribution of this paper is smoothed OWL (SOWL), a new family of norms, which  not
  only identifies the groups but also allows the model to be flexible inside a group.   We
  establish several algorithmic and theoretical properties of SOWL including group
  identification and model consistency. We also provide algorithmic tools to compute
  the SOWL norm and its proximal operator, whose computational complexity  $O(d\log
  d)$ is significantly better than that of general purpose solvers in $O(d^2\log d)$.
  In our experiments, SOWL compares favorably with respect to OWL in the regimes of
  interest.
