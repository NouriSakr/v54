title: Global Convergence of Non-Convex Gradient Descent for Computing Matrix Squareroot
abstract: 'While there has been a significant amount of work studying gradient descent
  techniques for non-convex optimization problems over the last few years, all existing
  results establish either local convergence with good rates or global convergence
  with highly suboptimal rates, for many problems of interest. In this paper, we take
  the first step in getting the best of both worlds – establishing global convergence
  and obtaining a good rate of convergence for the problem of computing squareroot
  of a positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix, which is a widely studied problem in numerical
  linear algebra with applications in machine learning and statistics among others.  Given
  a PSD matrix M and a PSD starting point $U_0$, we show that gradient descent with
  appropriately chosen step-size finds an epsilon-accurate squareroot of M in $O(α\log(||M-U_0||_F^2
  / ε))$ iterations, where $α=  (\max{||U_0||^2, ||M||} / \min{\sigma_min^2(U_0),
  \sigma_min(M)} )^3/2$. Our result is the first to establish global convergence for
  this problem and that it is robust to errors in each iteration.  A key contribution
  of our work is the general proof technique which we believe should further excite
  research in understanding deterministic and stochastic variants of simple non-convex
  gradient descent algorithms with good global convergence rates for other problems
  in machine learning and numerical linear algebra. '
