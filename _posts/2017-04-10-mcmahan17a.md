title: Communication-Efficient Learning of Deep Networks from Decentralized Data
abstract: 'Modern mobile devices have access to a wealth of data suitable for learning
  models, which in turn can greatly improve the user experience on the device. For
  example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image
  models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy
  sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center
  and training there using conventional approaches.  We advocate an alternative that
  leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared
  model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach
  Federated Learning.  We present a practical method for the federated learning of
  deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical
  evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These
  experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data
  distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication
  costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication
  rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent. '
