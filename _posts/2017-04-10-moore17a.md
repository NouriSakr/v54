title: Signal-based Bayesian Seismic Monitoring
abstract: Detecting weak seismic events from noisy sensors is a difficult perceptual
  task. We formulate this task as Bayesian inference and propose a generative model
  of seismic events and signals across a network of spatially distributed stations.
  Our system, SIGVISA, is the first to directly model seismic waveforms, allowing
  it to incorporate a rich representation of the physics underlying the signal generation
  process. We use Gaussian processes over wavelet parameters to predict detailed waveform
  fluctuations based on historical events, while degrading smoothly to simple parametric
  envelopes in regions with no historical seismicity. Evaluating on data from the
  western US, we recover three times as many events as previous work, and reduce mean
  location errors by a factor of four while greatly increasing sensitivity to low-magnitude
  events.
