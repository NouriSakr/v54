title: Encrypted Accelerated Least Squares Regression
abstract: Information that is stored in an encrypted format is, by definition, usually
  not amenable to statistical analysis or machine learning methods. In this paper
  we present detailed analysis of coordinate and accelerated gradient descent algorithms
  which are capable of fitting least squares and penalised ridge regression models,
  using data encrypted under a fully homomorphic encryption scheme.  Gradient descent
  is shown to dominate in terms of encrypted computational speed, and theoretical
  results are proven to give parameter bounds which ensure correctness of decryption.  The
  characteristics of encrypted computation are empirically shown to favour a non-standard
  acceleration technique.  This demonstrates the possibility of approximating conventional
  statistical regression methods using encrypted data without compromising privacy.
