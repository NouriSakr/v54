title: Markov Chain Truncation for Doubly-Intractable Inference
abstract: Computing partition functions, the normalizing constants of probability
  distributions, is often hard. Variants of importance sampling give unbiased estimates
  of a normalizer Z, however, unbiased estimates of the reciprocal 1/Z are harder
  to obtain. Unbiased estimates of 1/Z allow Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling of
  “doubly-intractable” distributions, such as the parameter posterior for Markov Random
  Fields or Exponential Random Graphs. We demonstrate how to construct unbiased estimates
  for 1/Z given access to black-box importance sampling estimators for Z. We adapt
  recent work on random series truncation and Markov chain coupling, producing estimators
  with lower variance and a higher percentage of positive estimates than before. Our
  debiasing algorithms are simple to implement, and have some theoretical and empirical
  advantages over existing methods.
