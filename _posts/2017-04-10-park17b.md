title: Rapid Mixing Swendsen-Wang Sampler for Stochastic Partitioned Attractive Models
abstract: The Gibbs sampler is the most popular Markov chain used for learning and
  inference problems in Graphical Models (GM). These tasks are computationally intractable
  in general, and the Gibbs sampler often suffers from slow  mixing. In this paper,
  we study the Swendsen-Wang  dynamics which is a more sophisticated Markov chain
  designed to overcome bottlenecks that impede Gibbs sampler. We prove O(log n) mixing
  time for attractive binary pairwise GMs (i.e., ferromagnetic Ising models) on stochastic
  partitioned graphs  having n vertices, under some mild conditions including low
  temperature regions where the Gibbs sampler provably mixes exponentially slow. Our
  experiments also confirm that the Swendsen-Wang sampler  significantly outperforms
  the Gibbs sampler for learning parameters of attractive GMs.
