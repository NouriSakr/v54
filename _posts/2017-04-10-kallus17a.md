title: A Framework for Optimal Matching for Causal Inference
abstract: We propose a novel framework for matching estimators for causal effect from
  observational data that is based on minimizing the dual norm of estimation error
  when expressed as an operator. We show that many popular matching estimators can
  be expressed as optimal in this framework, including nearest-neighbor matching,
  coarsened exact matching, and mean-matched sampling. This reveals their motivation
  and aptness as structural priors formulated by embedding the effect in a particular
  functional space. This also gives rise to a range of new, kernel-based matching
  estimators that arise when one embeds the effect in a reproducing kernel Hilbert
  space. Depending on the case, these estimators can be found using either quadratic
  optimization or integer optimization. We show that estimators based on universal
  kernels are universally consistent without model specification. In empirical results
  using both synthetic and real data, the new, kernel-based estimators outperform
  all standard causal estimators in estimation error.
