title: Adaptive ADMM with Spectral Penalty Parameter Selection
abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a versatile tool
  for solving a wide range of constrained optimization problems. However, its performance
  is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter,  making ADMM often unreliable and hard
  to automate for a non-expert user.  We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing
  a method that adaptively tunes the penalty parameter to achieve fast convergence.
  The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM)  algorithm, inspired by the  successful Barzilai-Borwein
  spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity
  to the initial stepsize  and problem scaling.
