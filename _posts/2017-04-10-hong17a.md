title: High-dimensional Time Series Clustering via Cross-Predictability
abstract: 'The key to time series clustering is how to characterize the similarity
  between any two time series.  In this paper, we explore a new similarity metric
  called “cross-predictability”: the degree to which a future value in each time series
  is predicted by past values of the others.  However, it is challenging to estimate
  such cross-predictability among time series in the high-dimensional regime, where
  the number of time series is much larger than the length of each time series. We
  address this challenge with a sparsity assumption: only time series in the same
  cluster have significant cross-predictability with each other.  We demonstrate that
  this approach is computationally attractive, and  provide a theoretical proof that
  the proposed algorithm will identify the correct clustering structure with high
  probability under certain conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
  first practical high-dimensional time series clustering algorithm with a provable
  guarantee.  We evaluate with experiments on both synthetic data and real-world data,
  and results indicate that our method can achieve more than 80% clustering accuracy
  on real-world data, which is 20% higher than the state-of-art baselines.'
