title: Robust Causal Estimation in the Large-Sample Limit without Strict Faithfulness
abstract: Causal effect estimation from observational data is an important and much
  studied research topic. The instrumental variable (IV) and local causal discovery
  (LCD) patterns are canonical examples of settings where a closed-form expression
  exists for the causal effect of one variable on another, given the presence of a
  third variable. Both rely on faithfulness to infer that the latter only influences
  the target effect via the cause variable. In reality, it is likely that this assumption
  only holds approximately and that there will be at least some form of weak interaction.
  This brings about the paradoxical situation that, in the large-sample limit, no
  predictions are made, as detecting the weak edge invalidates the setting.  We introduce
  an alternative approach by replacing strict faithfulness with a prior that reflects
  the existence of many ’weak’ (irrelevant) and ’strong’ interactions. We obtain a
  posterior distribution over the target causal effect estimator which shows that,
  in many cases, we can still make good estimates. We demonstrate the approach in
  an application on a simple linear-Gaussian setting, using the MultiNest sampling
  algorithm, and compare it with established techniques to show our method is robust
  even when strict faithfulness is violated.
