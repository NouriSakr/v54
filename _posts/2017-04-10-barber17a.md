title: Complementary Sum Sampling for Likelihood Approximation in Large Scale Classification
abstract: 'We consider training probabilistic classifiers in the case that the number
  of classes is too large to perform exact normalisation over all classes.  We show
  that the source of high variance in standard sampling approximations is due to simply
  not including the correct class of the datapoint into the approximation. To account
  for this we explicitly sum over a subset of classes and sample the remaining. We
  show that this simple approach is competitive with recently introduced non likelihood-based
  approximations. '
