title: Efficient Algorithm for Sparse Tensor-variate Gaussian Graphical Models via
  Gradient Descent
abstract: We study the sparse tensor-variate Gaussian graphical model (STGGM), where
  each way of the tensor follows a multivariate normal distribution whose precision
  matrix has sparse structures. In order to estimate the precision matrices, we propose
  a sparsity constrained maximum likelihood estimator. However, due to the complex
  structure of the tensor-variate GGMs, the likelihood based estimator is non-convex,
  which poses great challenges for both computation and theoretical analysis. In order
  to address these challenges, we propose an efficient alternating gradient descent
  algorithm to solve this estimator, and prove that, under certain conditions on the
  initial estimator, our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly converge to the unknown
  precision matrices up to the optimal statistical error. Experiments on both synthetic
  data and real world brain imaging data corroborate our theory.
