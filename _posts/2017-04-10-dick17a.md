title: Data Driven Resource Allocation for Distributed Learning
abstract: In distributed machine learning, data is dispatched to multiple machines
  for processing. Motivated by the fact that similar data points often belong to the
  same or similar classes, and more generally, classification rules of high accuracy
  tend to be “locally simple but globally complex” (Vapnik and Bottou, 1993), we propose
  data dependent dispatching that takes advantage of such structure. We present an
  in-depth analysis of this model, providing new algorithms with provable worst-case
  guarantees, analysis proving existing scalable heuristics perform well in natural
  non worst-case conditions, and techniques for extending a dispatching rule from
  a small sample to the entire distribution. We overcome novel technical challenges
  to satisfy important conditions for accurate distributed learning, including fault
  tolerance and balancedness. We empirically compare our approach with baselines based
  on random partitioning, balanced partition trees, and locality sensitive hashing,
  showing that we achieve significantly higher accuracy on both synthetic and real
  world image and advertising datasets. We also demonstrate that our technique strongly
  scales with the available computing power.
