title: Greedy Direction Method of Multiplier for MAP Inference of Large Output Domain
abstract: Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) inference lies at the heart of Graphical Models
  and Structured Prediction. Despite the intractability of exact MAP inference, approximated
  methods based on LP relaxations have exhibited superior performance across a wide
  range of applications. Yet for problems involving large output domains (i.e., the
  state space for each variable is large), standard LP relaxations can easily give
  rise to a large number of variables and constraints which are beyond the limit of
  existing optimization algorithms. In this paper, we introduce an effective MAP inference
  method for problems with large output domains. The method builds upon alternating
  minimization of an Augmented Lagrangian that exploits the sparsity of messages through
  greedy optimization techniques. A key feature of our greedy approach is to introduce
  variables in an on-demand manner with a pre-built data structure over local factors.
  This results in a single-loop algorithm of sublinear cost per iteration and O(log(1/epsilon))-type
  iteration complexity to achieve epsilon sub-optimality. In addition, we introduce
  a variant of GDMM for binary MAP inference problems with a large number of factors.
  Empirically, the proposed algorithms demonstrate orders of magnitude speedup over
  state-of-the-art MAP inference techniques on MAP inference problems including Segmentation,
  Alignment, Protein Folding, Graph Matching, and Pairwise-Interacted Multilabel Prediction.
