title: 'CPSG-MCMC: Clustering-Based Preprocessing method for Stochastic Gradient MCMC'
abstract: In recent years, stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC)
  methods have been raised to process large-scale dataset by iterative learning from
  small minibatches.  However, the high variance caused by naive subsampling usually
  slows down the convergence to the desired posterior distribution. In this paper,
  we propose an effective subsampling strategy to reduce the variance based on a failed
  attempt to do importance sampling. In particular, before sampling,  we partition
  the dataset with k-means clustering algorithm in a preprocessing step and use the
  fixed clustering throughout the entire MCMC simulation.  Then during simulation,
  we approximate the gradient of log-posterior via summing the estimated gradient
  of each cluster.  The resulting procedure is surprisingly simple without enhancing
  the complexity of the original algorithm during sampling procedure. We apply our
  Clustering-based Preprocessing strategy on stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics,
  stochastic gradient Hamilton Monte Carlo and stochastic gradient Riemann Langevin
  dynamics. Empirically, we provide thorough numerical results to back up the effectiveness
  and efficiency of our approach.
