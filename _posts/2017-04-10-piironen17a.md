title: On the Hyperprior Choice for the Global Shrinkage Parameter in the Horseshoe
  Prior
abstract: The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse
  Bayesian estimation, but as shown in this paper, the results can be sensitive to
  the prior choice for the global shrinkage hyperparameter. We argue that the previous
  default choices are dubious due to their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk
  coefficients than we typically expect a priori. This can lead to bad results if
  this parameter is not strongly identified by data. We derive the relationship between
  the global parameter and the effective number of nonzeros in the coefficient vector,
  and show an easy and intuitive way of setting up the prior for the global parameter
  based on our prior beliefs about the number of nonzero coefficients in the model.
  The results on real world data show that one can benefit greatly – in terms of improved
  parameter estimates, prediction accuracy, and reduced computation time – from transforming
  even a crude guess for the number of nonzero coefficients into the prior for the
  global parameter using our framework.
