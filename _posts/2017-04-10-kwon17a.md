title: 'Online Learning and Blackwell Approachability with Partial Monitoring: Optimal
  Convergence Rates'
abstract: Blackwell approachability is an online learning setup generalizing the classical
  problem of regret minimization by allowing for instance multi-criteria optimization,
  global (online) optimization of a convex loss, or online linear optimization under
  some cumulative constraint. We consider partial monitoring where the decision maker
  does not necessarily observe the outcomes of his decision (unlike the traditional
  regret/bandit literature). Instead, he receives a random signal correlated to the
  decisionâ€“outcome pair, or only to the outcome.  We construct, for the first time,
  approachability algorithms with convergence rate of order $O(T^-1/2)$ when the signal
  is independent of the decision and of order $O(T^-1/3)$ in the case of general signals.
  Those rates are optimal in the sense that they cannot be improved without further
  assumption on the structure of the objectives and/or the signals.
