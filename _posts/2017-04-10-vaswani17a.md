title: Horde of Bandits using Gaussian Markov Random Fields
abstract: 'The gang of bandits (GOB) model [7] is a recent contextual bandits framework
  that shares information between a set of bandit problems, related by a known (possibly
  noisy) graph. This model is useful in problems like recommender systems where the
  large number of users makes it vital to transfer information between users. Despite
  its effectiveness, the existing GOB model can only be applied to small problems
  due to its quadratic time-dependence on the number of nodes. Existing solutions
  to combat the scalability issue require an often-unrealistic  clustering assumption.
  By exploiting a connection to Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), we show that
  the GOB model can be made to scale to much larger graphs without additional assumptions.
  In addition, we propose a Thompson sampling algorithm which uses the recent GMRF
  sampling-by-perturbation technique, allowing it to scale to even larger problems
  (leading to a “horde” of bandits). We give regret bounds and experimental results
  for GOB with Thompson sampling and epoch-greedy algorithms, indicating that these
  methods are as good as or significantly better than ignoring the graph or adopting
  a clustering-based approach. Finally, when an existing graph is not available, we
  propose a heuristic for learning it on the fly and show promising results. '
