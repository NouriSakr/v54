title: Lipschitz Density-Ratios, Structured Data, and Data-driven Tuning
abstract: 'Density-ratio estimation (i.e. estimating $f = f_Q/f_P$ for two unknown
  distributions Q and P) has proved useful in many Machine Learning tasks, e.g., risk-calibration
  in transfer-learning, two-sample tests, and also useful in common techniques such
  importance sampling and bias correction. While there are many important analyses
  of this estimation problem, the present paper derives convergence rates in other
  practical settings that are less understood, namely, extensions of traditional Lipschitz
  smoothness conditions, and common high-dimensional settings with structured data
  (e.g. manifold data, sparse data).   Various interesting facts, which hold in earlier
  settings, are shown to extend to these settings. Namely, (1) optimal rates depend
  only on the smoothness of the ratio f, and not on the densities $f_Q$, $f_P$, supporting
  the belief that plugging in estimates for $f_Q$, $f_P$ is suboptimal; (2) optimal
  rates depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data, i.e. this problem – unlike
  density estimation – escapes the curse of dimension.   We further show that near-optimal
  rates are attainable by estimators tuned from data alone, i.e. with no prior distributional
  information. This last fact is of special interest in unsupervised settings such
  as this one, where only oracle rates seem to be known, i.e., rates which assume
  critical distributional information usually unavailable in practice. '
