title: 'Fairness Constraints: Mechanisms for Fair Classification'
abstract: Algorithmic decision making systems are ubiquitous across a wide variety
  of online as well as offline services. These systems rely on complex learning methods
  and vast amounts of data to optimize the service functionality, satisfaction of
  the end user and profitability. However, there is a growing concern that these automated
  decisions can lead, even in the absence of intent, to a lack of fairness, i.e.,
  their outcomes can disproportionately hurt (or, benefit) particular groups of people
  sharing one or more sensitive attributes (e.g., race, sex). In this paper, we introduce
  a flexible mechanism to design fair classifiers by leveraging a novel intuitive
  measure of decision boundary (un)fairness. We instantiate this mechanism with two
  well-known classifiers, logistic regression and support vector machines, and show
  on real-world data that our mechanism allows for a fine-grained control on the degree
  of fairness, often at a small cost in terms of accuracy.
