title: 'Learning Graphical Games from Behavioral Data: Sufficient and Necessary Conditions'
abstract: In this paper we obtain sufficient and necessary conditions on the number
  of samples required for exact recovery of the pure-strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE)
  set of a graphical game from noisy observations of joint actions. We consider sparse
  linear influence games — a parametric class of graphical games with linear payoffs,
  and represented by directed graphs of n nodes (players) and in-degree of at most
  k. We show that one can efficiently recover the PSNE set of a linear influence game
  with $O(k^2 \log n)$ samples, under very general observation models. On the other
  hand, we show that $Ω(k \log n)$ samples are necessary for any procedure to recover
  the PSNE set from observations of joint actions.
