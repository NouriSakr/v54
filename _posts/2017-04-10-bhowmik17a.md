title: Frequency Domain Predictive Modelling with Aggregated Data
abstract: Existing work in spatio-temporal data analysis invariably assumes data available
  as individual measurements with localised estimates. However, for many applications
  like econometrics, financial forecasting and climate science, data is often obtained
  as aggregates. Data aggregation presents severe mathematical challenges to learning
  and inference, and application of standard techniques is susceptible to ecological
  fallacy. In this manuscript we investigate the problem of predictive linear modelling
  in the scenario where data is aggregated in a non-uniform manner across targets
  and features. We introduce a novel formulation of the problem in the frequency domain,
  and develop algorithmic techniques that exploit the duality properties of Fourier
  analysis to bypass the inherent structural challenges of this setting. We provide
  theoretical guarantees for generalisation error for our estimation procedure and
  extend our analysis to capture approximation effects arising from aliasing. Finally,
  we perform empirical evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithmic aproach
  in predictive modelling on synthetic data, and on three real datasets from agricultural
  studies, ecological surveys and climate science. approximation effects arising from

  our algorithmic aproach in predictive modelling on synthetic data, and on three
