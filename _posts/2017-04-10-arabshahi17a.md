title: Spectral Methods for Correlated Topic Models
abstract: In this paper we propose guaranteed spectral methods for learning a broad
  range of topic models, which generalize the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation
  (LDA). We overcome the limitation of LDA to incorporate arbitrary topic correlations,
  by assuming that the hidden topic proportions are drawn from a flexible class of
  Normalized Infinitely Divisible (NID) distributions. NID distributions are generated
  by normalizing a family of independent Infinitely Divisible (ID) random variables.
  The Dirichlet distribution is a special case obtained by normalizing a set of Gamma
  random variables. We prove that this flexible topic model class can be learnt via
  spectral methods using only moments up to the third order, with (low order) polynomial
  sample and computational complexity. The proof is based on a key new technique derived
  here that allows us to diagonalize the moments of the NID distribution through an
  efficient procedure that requires evaluating only univariate integrals, despite
  the fact that we are handling high dimensional multivariate moments. In order to
  assess the performance of our proposed Latent NID topic model, we use two real datasets
  of articles collected from New York Times and Pubmed. Our experiments yield improved
  perplexity on both datasets compared with the baseline.
