title: Co-Occurring Directions Sketching for Approximate Matrix Multiply
abstract: We introduce co-occurring directions sketching, a deterministic algorithm
  for approximate matrix product (AMM), in the streaming model. We show that co-occurring
  directions achieves a better error bound for AMM than other randomized and deterministic
  approaches for AMM. Co-occurring directions gives a (1 + epsilon) - approximation
  of the optimal low rank approximation of a matrix product. Empirically our algorithm
  outperforms competing methods for AMM, for a small sketch size. We validate empirically
  our theoretical findings and algorithms.
