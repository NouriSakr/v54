title: Sequential Graph Matching with Sequential Monte Carlo
abstract: We develop a novel probabilistic model for graph matchings and develop practical
  inference methods for supervised and unsupervised learning of the parameters of
  this model. The framework we develop admits joint inference on the parameters and
  the matching. Furthermore, our framework generalizes naturally to $K$-partite hypergraph
  matchings or set packing problems. The sequential formulation of the graph matching
  process naturally leads to sequential Monte Carlo algorithms which can be combined
  with various parameter inference methods. We apply our method to image matching
  problems, document ranking, and our own novel quadripartite matching problem arising
  from the field of computational forestry.
