title: Initialization and Coordinate Optimization for Multi-way Matching
abstract: We consider the problem of consistently matching multiple sets of elements
  to each other, which is a common task in fields such as computer vision. To solve
  the underlying NP-hard objective, existing methods often relax or approximate it,
  but end up with unsatisfying empirical performance due to a misaligned objective.
  We propose a coordinate update algorithm that directly optimizes the target objective.
  By using pairwise alignment information to build an undirected graph and initializing
  the permutation matrices along the edges of its Maximum Spanning Tree, our algorithm
  successfully avoids bad local optima. Theoretically, with high probability our algorithm
  guarantees an optimal solution under reasonable noise assumptions. Empirically,
  our algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods on several
  benchmark tasks on real datasets.
