title: Generalized Pseudolikelihood Methods for Inverse Covariance Estimation
abstract: We introduce PseudoNet, a new pseudolikelihood-based estimator of the inverse
  covariance matrix, that has a number of useful statistical and computational properties.  We
  show, through detailed experiments with synthetic and also real-world finance as
  well as wind power data, that PseudoNet outperforms related methods in terms of
  estimation error and support recovery, making it well-suited for use in a downstream
  application, where obtaining low estimation error can be important.  We also show,
  under regularity conditions, that PseudoNet is consistent.  Our proof assumes the
  existence of accurate estimates of the diagonal entries of the underlying inverse
  covariance matrix; we additionally provide a two-step method to obtain these estimates,
  even in a high-dimensional setting, going beyond the proofs for related methods.  Unlike
  other pseudolikelihood-based methods, we also show that PseudoNet does not saturate,
  i.e., in high dimensions, there is no hard limit on the number of nonzero entries
  in the PseudoNet estimate.  We present a fast algorithm as well as screening rules
  that make computing the PseudoNet estimate over a range of tuning parameters tractable.
