title: On the Interpretability of Conditional Probability Estimates in the Agnostic
  Setting
abstract: 'We study the interpretability of conditional probability estimates for
  binary classification under the agnostic setting or scenario. Under the agnostic
  setting, conditional probability estimates do not necessarily reflect the true conditional
  probabilities. Instead, they have a certain calibration property: among all data
  points that the classifier has predicted $P(Y = 1|X) = p$, $p$ portion of them actually
  have label $Y = 1$. For cost-sensitive decision problems, this calibration property
  provides adequate support for us to use Bayes Decision Theory. In this paper, we
  define a novel measure for the calibration property together with its empirical
  counterpart, and prove an uniform convergence result between them. This new measure
  enables us to formally justify the calibration property of conditional probability
  estimations, and provides new insights on the problem of estimating and calibrating
  conditional probabilities. '
