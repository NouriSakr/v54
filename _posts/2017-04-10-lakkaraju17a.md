title: Learning Cost-Effective and Interpretable Treatment Regimes
abstract: Decision makers, such as doctors and judges, make crucial decisions such
  as recommending treatments to patients, and granting bails to defendants on a daily
  basis. Such decisions typically involve weighting the potential benefits of taking
  an action against the costs involved.  In this work, we aim to automate this task
  of learning cost-effective, interpretable and actionable treatment regimes. We formulate
  this as a problem of learning a decision list – a sequence of if-then-else rules
  – which maps characteristics of subjects (eg., diagnostic test results of patients)
  to treatments. We propose a novel objective to construct a decision list which maximizes
  outcomes for the population, and minimizes overall costs. Since we do not observe
  the outcomes corresponding to counterfactual scenarios, we use techniques from causal
  inference literature to infer them. We model the problem of learning the decision
  list as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and employ a variant of the Upper Confidence
  Bound for Trees (UCT) strategy which leverages customized checks for pruning the
  search space effectively.  Experimental results on real world observational data
  capturing judicial bail decisions and treatment recommendations for asthma patients
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
