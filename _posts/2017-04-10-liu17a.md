title: Attributing Hacks
abstract: In this paper, we describe an algorithm for estimating the provenance of
  hacks on websites. That is, given properties of sites and the temporal occurrence
  of attacks, we are able to attribute individual attacks to joint causes and vulnerabilities,
  as well as estimating the evolution of these vulnerabilities over time. Specifically,
  we use hazard regression with a time-varying additive hazard function parameterized
  in a generalized linear form. The activation coefficients on each feature are continuous-time
  functions over time. We formulate the problem of learning these functions as a constrained
  variational maximum likelihood estimation problem with total variation penalty and
  show that the optimal solution is a 0th order spline (a piecewise constant function)
  with a finite number of adaptively chosen knots. This allows the inference problem
  to be solved efficiently and at scale by solving a finite dimensional optimization
  problem. Extensive experiments on real data sets show that our method significantly
  outperforms Coxâ€™s proportional hazard model. We also conduct case studies and verify
  that the fitted functions are indeed recovering vulnerable features.
