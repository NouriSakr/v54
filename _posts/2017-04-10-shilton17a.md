title: Regret Bounds for Transfer Learning in Bayesian Optimisation
abstract: This paper studies the regret bound of two transfer learning algorithms
  in Bayesian optimisation. The first algorithm models any difference between the
  source and target functions as a noise process. The second algorithm proposes a
  new way to model the difference between the source and target as a Gaussian process
  which is then used to adapt the source data. We show that in both cases the regret
  bounds are tighter than in the no transfer case. We also experimentally compare
  the performance of these algorithms relative to no transfer learning and demonstrate
  benefits of transfer learning.
