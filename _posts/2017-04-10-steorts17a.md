title: Performance Bounds for Graphical Record Linkage
abstract: 'Record linkage involves merging records in large, noisy databases to remove
  duplicate entities.  It has become an important area because of its widespread occurrence
  in bibliometrics, public health, official statistics production, political science,
  and beyond. Traditional linkage methods  directly linking records to one another
  are computationally infeasible as the number of records grows. As a result, it is
  increasingly common for researchers to treat linkage as a clustering task, in which
  each latent entity is associated with one or more noisy database records. We critically
  assess performance bounds  using the  Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence under a Bayesian
  record linkage framework, making connections to Kolchin partition models. We provide
  an upper bound using the KL divergence and a lower bound on the minimum probability
  of misclassifying a latent entity. We give insights for when our bounds hold using
  simulated data and provide practical user guidance. '
