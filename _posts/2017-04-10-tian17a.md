title: Communication-efficient Distributed Sparse Linear Discriminant Analysis
abstract: We propose a communication-efficient distributed estimation method for sparse
  linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in the high dimensional regime. Our method distributes
  the data of size N into m machines, and estimates a local sparse LDA estimator on
  each machine using the data subset of size N/m. After the distributed estimation,
  our method aggregates the debiased local estimators from m machines, and sparsifies
  the aggregated estimator. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same
  statistical rate as the centralized estimation method, as long as the number of
  machines m is chosen appropriately. Moreover, we prove that our method can attain
  the model selection consistency under a milder condition than the centralized method.
  Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets corroborate our theory.
