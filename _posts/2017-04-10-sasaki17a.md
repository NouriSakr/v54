title: Estimating Density Ridges by Direct Estimation of Density-Derivative-Ratios
abstract: Estimation of \emphdensity ridges has been gathering a great deal of attention
  since it enables us to reveal lower-dimensional structures hidden in data. Recently,
  \emphsubspace constrained mean shift (SCMS) was proposed as a practical algorithm
  for density ridge estimation. A key technical ingredient in SCMS is to accurately
  estimate the ratios of the density derivatives to the density. SCMS takes a three-step
  approach for this purpose â€” first estimating the data density, then computing its
  derivatives, and finally taking their ratios. However, this three-step approach
  can be unreliable because a good density estimator does not necessarily mean a good
  density derivative estimator and division by an estimated density could significantly
  magnify the estimation error. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel method
  that directly estimates the ratios without going through density estimation and
  division. Our proposed estimator has an analytic-form solution and it can be computed
  efficiently. We further establish a non-parametric convergence bound for the proposed
  ratio estimator. Finally, based on this direct ratio estimator, we develop a practical
  algorithm for density ridge estimation and experimentally demonstrate its usefulness
  on a variety of datasets.
