title: Clustering from Multiple Uncertain Experts
abstract: 'Utilizing expert input often improves clustering performance.   However
  in a knowledge discovery problem, ground truth is unknown even to an expert.   Thus,
  instead of one expert, we solicit the opinion from multiple experts. The key question
  motivating this work is: which experts should be assigned higher weights when  there
  is disagreement on whether to put a pair of samples in the same group? To model
  the uncertainty in constraints from different experts, we build a probabilistic
  model for  pairwise constraints through jointly modeling each expertâ€™s accuracy
  and the mapping from features to latent cluster assignments.  After learning our
  probabilistic discriminative clustering model and accuracies of different experts,
  1) samples that were not annotated by any expert can be clustered using the discriminative
  clustering model; and  2) experts with higher accuracies are automatically assigned
  higher weights in determining the  latent cluster assignments. Experimental results
  on UCI benchmark datasets and a real-world disease subtyping dataset demonstrate
  that our proposed approach outperforms competing alternatives, including semi-crowdsourced
  clustering,  semi-supervised clustering with constraints from majority voting,   and
  consensus clustering.'
