title: Efficient Online Multiclass Prediction on Graphs via Surrogate Losses
abstract: "    We develop computationally efficient algorithms for online multi-class
  prediction. Our construction is based on carefully-chosen data-dependent surrogate
  loss functions, and the new methods enjoy strong mistake bound guarantees.           To
  illustrate the technique, we study the combinatorial problem of node classification
  and develop a prediction strategy that is linear-time per round. In contrast, the
  offline benchmark is NP-hard to compute in general. We demonstrate the empirical
  performance of the method on several datasets.  "
