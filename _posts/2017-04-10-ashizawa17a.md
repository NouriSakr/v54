title: Least-Squares Log-Density Gradient Clustering for Riemannian Manifolds
abstract: Mean shift is a mode-seeking clustering algorithm that has been successfully
  used in a wide range of applications such as image segmentation and object tracking.
  To further improve the clustering performance, mean shift has been extended to various
  directions, including generalization to handle data on Riemannian manifolds and
  extension to directly estimating the density gradient without density estimation.
  In this paper, we combine these ideas and propose a novel mode-seeking algorithm
  for Riemannian manifolds with direct density-gradient estimation. Although the idea
  of combining the two extensions is rather straightforward, directly estimating the
  density gradient on Riemannian manifolds is mathematically challenging. We will
  provide a mathematically sound algorithm and demonstrate its usefulness through
  experiments.
