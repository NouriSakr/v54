title: Annular Augmentation Sampling
abstract: The exponentially large sample space of general binary probabilistic models  renders
  intractable standard operations such as exact marginalization, inference, and normalization.  Typically,
  researchers deal with these distributions via deterministic approximations, the
  class of belief propagation methods being a prominent example.  Comparatively, Markov
  Chain Monte Carlo methods have been significantly less used in this domain.  In
  this work, we introduce an auxiliary variable MCMC scheme that samples from an annular
  augmented space, translating to a great circle path around the hypercube of the
  binary sample space.  This annular augmentation sampler explores the sample space
  more effectively than coordinate-wise samplers and has no tunable parameters, leading
  to substantial performance gains in estimating quantities of interest in large binary
  models.  We extend the method to incorporate into the sampler any existing mean-field
  approximation (such as from belief propagation), leading to further performance
  improvements.  Empirically, we consider a range of large Ising models and an application
  to risk factors for heart disease.
