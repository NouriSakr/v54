title: Bayesian Learning and Inference in Recurrent Switching Linear Dynamical Systems
abstract: Many natural systems, such as neurons firing in the brain or basketball
  teams traversing a court, give rise to time series data with complex, nonlinear
  dynamics.  We can gain insight into these systems by decomposing the data into segments
  that are each explained by simpler dynamic units. Building on switching linear dynamical
  systems (SLDS), we develop a model class and Bayesian inference algorithms that
  not only discover these dynamical units but also, by learning how transition probabilities
  depend on observations or continuous latent states, explain their switching behavior.  Our
  key innovation is to design these recurrent SLDS models to enable recent PÃ³lya-gamma
  auxiliary variable techniques and thus make approximate Bayesian learning and inference
  in these models easy, fast, and scalable.
