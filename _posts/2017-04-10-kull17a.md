title: 'Beta calibration: a well-founded and easily implemented improvement on logistic
  calibration for binary classifiers'
abstract: 'For optimal decision making under variable class distributions and misclassification
  costs a classifier needs to produce well-calibrated estimates of the posterior probability.
  Isotonic calibration is a powerful non-parametric method that is however prone to
  overfitting on smaller datasets; hence a parametric method based on the logistic
  curve is commonly used. While logistic calibration is designed for normally distributed
  per-class scores, we demonstrate experimentally that many classifiers including
  Naive Bayes and Adaboost suffer from a particular distortion where these score distributions
  are heavily skewed. In such cases logistic calibration can easily yield probability
  estimates that are worse than the original scores. Moreover, the logistic curve
  family does not include the identity function, and hence logistic calibration can
  easily uncalibrate a perfectly calibrated classifier.  In this paper we solve all
  these problems with a richer class of calibration maps based on the beta distribution.
  We derive the method from first principles and show that fitting it is as easy as
  fitting a logistic curve. Extensive experiments show that beta calibration is superior
  to logistic calibration for Naive Bayes and Adaboost.  '
