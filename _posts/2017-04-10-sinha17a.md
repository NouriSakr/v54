title: Sparse Randomized Partition Trees for Nearest Neighbor Search
abstract: Randomized partition trees have recently been shown to be very effective
  in solving nearest neighbor search problem. In spite of enjoying strong theoretical
  guarantee, it suffers from high space complexity, since each internal node of the
  tree needs to store a $d$ dimensional projection direction leading to a $O(nd)$
  space complexity for a dataset of size $n$. Inspired by the fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss
  transform, in this paper, we propose a sparse version of randomized partition tree
  where each internal node needs to store only a few non-zero entries, as opposed
  to all $d$ entries,  leading to significant space savings without sacrificing  much
  in terms of nearest neighbor search accuracy. As a by product of this,  query time
  of our proposed method is slightly better than that of  its non-sparse counterpart
  for large dataset size.  Our theoretical results indicate that our proposed method
  enjoys the same theoretical guarantee as that of the original non-sparse RP-tree.
  Experimental evaluations on four real world dataset strongly  suggest that nearest
  neighbor search performance of our proposed sparse RP-tree is very similar to that
  of its non-sparse counterpart in terms of accuracy and number of retrieved points.
