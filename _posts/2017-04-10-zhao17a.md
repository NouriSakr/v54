title: Online Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with General Divergences
abstract: We develop a unified and systematic framework for performing online nonnegative
  matrix factorization under a wide variety of important divergences. The online nature
  of our algorithms makes them particularly amenable to large-scale data.  We prove
  that the sequence of learned dictionaries converges almost surely to the set of
  critical points of the expected loss function. Experimental results demonstrate
  the computational efficiency and outstanding performances of our algorithms on several
  real-life applications, including topic modeling, document clustering and foreground-background
  separation.
