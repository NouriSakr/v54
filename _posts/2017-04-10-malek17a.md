title: Sequential Multiple Hypothesis Testing with Type I Error Control
abstract: This work studies multiple hypothesis testing in the setting when we obtain
  data sequentially and may choose when to stop sampling. We summarize the notion
  of a sequential p-value (one that can be continually updated and still maintain
  a type I error guarantee) and provide several examples from the literature. This
  tool allows us to convert step-up or step-down multiple hypothesis testing procedures
  in the fixed-horizon setting (which includes Benjamini-Hochberg, Holm, and Bonferroni)  into
  sequential versions that allow the statistician to reject a hypothesis as soon as
  the sequential p-value reaches a threshold. We show that if the original procedure
  has a type I error guarantee in a certain family (including FDR and FWER), then
  the sequential conversion inherits an analogous guarantee. The conversion also allows
  for allocating samples in a data-dependent way, and we provide simulated experiments
  demonstrating an increased number of rejections when compared to the fixed-horizon
  setting.
