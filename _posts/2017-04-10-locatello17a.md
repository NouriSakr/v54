title: A Unified Optimization View on Generalized Matching Pursuit and Frank-Wolfe
abstract: Two of the most fundamental prototypes of greedy optimization are the matching
  pursuit and Frank-Wolfe algorithms. In this paper we take a unified view on both
  classes of methods, leading to the first explicit convergence rates of matching
  pursuit methods in an optimization sense, for general sets of atoms. We derive sublinear
  (1/t) convergence for both classes on general smooth objectives, and linear convergence
  on strongly convex objectives, as well as a clear correspondence of algorithm variants.
  Our presented algorithms and rates are affine invariant, and do not need any incoherence
  or sparsity assumptions.
