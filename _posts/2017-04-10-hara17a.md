title: Consistent and Efficient Nonparametric Different-Feature Selection
abstract: Two-sample feature selection is a ubiquitous problem in both scientific
  and engineering studies. We propose a feature selection method to find features
  that describe a difference in two probability distributions. The proposed method
  is nonparametric and does not assume any specific parametric models on data distributions.
  We show that the proposed method is computationally efficient and does not require
  any extra computation for model selection. Moreover, we prove that the proposed
  method provides a consistent estimator of features under mild conditions. Our experimental
  results show that the proposed method outperforms the current method with regard
  to both accuracy and computation time.
