title: Removing Phase Transitions from Gibbs Measures
abstract: Gibbs measures are a fundamental class of distributions for the analysis
  of high dimensional data. Phase transitions, which are also known as degeneracy
  in the network science literature, are an emergent property of these models that
  well describe many physical systems. However, the reach of the Gibbs measure is
  now far outside the realm of physical systems, and in many of these domains multiphase
  behavior is a nuisance. This nuisance often makes distribution fitting impossible
  due to failure of the MCMC sampler, and even when an MLE fit is possible, if the
  solution is near a phase transition point, the plausibility of the fit can be highly
  questionable. We introduce a modification to the Gibbs distribution that reduces
  the effects of phase transitions, and with properly chosen hyper-parameters, provably
  removes all multiphase behavior. We show that this new distribution is just as easy
  to fit via MCMCMLE as the Gibbs measure, and provide examples in the Ising model
  from statistical physics and ERGMs from network science.
