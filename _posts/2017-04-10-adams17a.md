title: Learning Time Series Detection Models from Temporally Imprecise Labels
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider a new low-quality label learning problem: learning
  time series detection models from temporally imprecise labels. In this problem,
  the data consist of a set of input time series, and supervision is provided by a
  sequence of noisy time stamps corresponding to the occurrence of positive class
  events. Such temporally imprecise labels commonly occur in areas like mobile health
  research where human annotators are tasked with labeling the occurrence of very
  short duration events. We propose a general learning framework for this problem
  that can accommodate different base classifiers and noise models. We present results
  on real mobile health data showing that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
  a number of alternatives including assuming that the label time stamps are noise-free,
  transforming the problem into the multiple instance learning framework, and learning
  on labels that were manually re-aligned.'
