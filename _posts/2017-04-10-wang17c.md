title: Tracking Objects with Higher Order Interactions via Delayed Column Generation
abstract: We study the problem of multi-target tracking and data association in video.
  We formulate this in terms of selecting a subset of high-quality tracks subject
  to the constraint that no pair of selected tracks is associated with a common detection
  (of an object). This objective is equivalent to the classic NP-hard problem of finding
  a maximum-weight set packing (MWSP) where tracks correspond to sets and is made
  further difficult since the number of candidate tracks grows exponentially in the
  number of detections.  We present a relaxation of this combinatorial problem that
  uses a column generation formulation where the pricing problem is solved via dynamic
  programming to efficiently explore the space of tracks.  We employ row generation
  to tighten the bound in such a way as to preserve efficient inference in the pricing
  problem.  We show the practical utility of this algorithm for pedestrian and particle
  tracking.
