title: Learning Optimal Interventions
abstract: 'Our goal is to identify beneficial interventions from observational data.  We
  consider interventions that are narrowly focused (impacting few covariates) and
  may be tailored to each individual or globally enacted over a population.  For applications
  where harmful intervention is drastically worse than proposing no change, we propose
  a conservative definition of the optimal intervention.  Assuming the underlying
  relationship remains invariant under intervention, we develop  efficient algorithms
  to identify the optimal intervention policy from limited data and provide theoretical
  guarantees for our approach in a Gaussian Process setting.  Although our methods
  assume covariates can be precisely adjusted, they remain capable of improving outcomes
  in misspecified settings with unintentional downstream effects.  Empirically, our
  approach identifies good interventions in two practical applications: gene perturbation
  and writing improvement. '
