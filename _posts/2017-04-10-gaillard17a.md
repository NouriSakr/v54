title: Sparse Accelerated Exponential Weights
abstract: 'We consider the stochastic optimization problem where a convex function
  is minimized observing recursively the gradients.  We introduce SAEW, a new procedure
  that accelerates exponential weights procedures with the slow rate $1/\sqrtT$ to
  procedures achieving the fast rate $1/T$. Under the strong convexity of the risk,
  we achieve the optimal rate of convergence for approximating sparse parameters in
  $R^d$. The acceleration is achieved by using successive  averaging steps in an online
  fashion. The procedure also produces sparse estimators thanks to additional hard
  threshold steps. '
