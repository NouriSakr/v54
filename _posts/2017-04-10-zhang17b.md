title: Scalable Convex Multiple Sequence Alignment via Entropy-Regularized Dual Decomposition
abstract: Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is one of the fundamental tasks in biological
  sequence analysis that underlies applications such as phylogenetic trees, profiles,
  and structure prediction. The task, however, is NP-hard, and the current practice
  resorts to heuristic and local-search methods. Recently, a convex optimization approach
  for MSA was proposed based on the concept of atomic norm, which demonstrates significant
  improvement over existing methods in the quality of alignments. However, the convex
  program is challenging to solve due to the constraint given by the intersection
  of two atomic-norm balls, for which the existing algorithm can only handle sequences
  of length up to 50, with an iteration complexity subject to constants of unknown
  relation to the natural parameters of MSA. In this work, we propose an accelerated
  dual decomposition algorithm that exploits entropy regularization to induce closed-form
  solutions for each atomic-norm-constrained subproblem, giving a single-loop algorithm
  of iteration complexity linear to the problem size (total length of all sequences).
  The proposed algorithm gives significantly better alignments than existing methods
  on sequences of length up to hundreds, where the existing convex programming method
  fails to converge in one day.
