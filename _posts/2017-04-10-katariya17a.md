title: Stochastic Rank-1 Bandits
abstract: We propose stochastic rank-1 bandits, a class of online learning problems
  where at each step a learning agent chooses a pair of row and column arms, and receives
  the product of their values as a reward. The main challenge of the problem is that
  the individual values of the row and column are unobserved. We assume that these
  values are stochastic and drawn independently. We propose a computationally-efficient
  algorithm for solving our problem, which we call Rank1Elim. We derive a O((K + L)
  (1 / Delta) log n) upper bound on its n-step regret, where K is the number of rows,
  L is the number of columns, and Delta is the minimum of the row and column gaps;
  under the assumption that the mean row and column rewards are bounded away from
  zero. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first bandit algorithm that finds
  the maximum entry of a rank-1 matrix whose regret is linear in K + L, 1 / Delta,
  and log n. We also derive a nearly matching lower bound. Finally, we evaluate Rank1Elim
  empirically on multiple problems. We observe that it leverages the structure of
  our problems and can learn near-optimal solutions even if our modeling assumptions
  are mildly violated.
