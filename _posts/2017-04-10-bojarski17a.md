title: Structured adaptive and random spinners for fast machine learning computations
abstract: We consider an efficient computational framework for speeding up several
  machine learning algorithms with almost no loss of accuracy. The proposed framework
  relies on projections via structured matrices that we call Structured Spinners,
  which are formed as products of three structured matrix-blocks that incorporate
  rotations. The approach is highly generic, i.e. i) structured matrices under consideration
  can either be fully-randomized or learned, ii) our structured family contains as
  special cases all previously considered structured schemes, iii) the setting extends
  to the non-linear case where the projections are followed by non-linear functions,
  and iv) the method finds numerous applications including kernel approximations via
  random feature maps, dimensionality reduction algorithms,new fast cross-polytope
  LSH techniques, deep learning, convex optimization algorithms via Newton sketches,
  quantization with random projection trees, and more. The proposed framework comes
  with theoretical guarantees characterizing the capacity of the structured model
  in reference to its unstructured counterpart and is based on a general theoretical
  principle that we describe in the paper. As a consequence of our theoretical analysis,
  we provide the first theoretical guarantees for one of the most efficient existing
  LSH algorithms based on the HD 3 HD 2 HD 1 structured matrix [Andoni et al., 2015].
  The exhaustive experimental evaluation confirms the accuracy and efficiency of structured
  spinners for a variety of different applications.
