title: Reparameterization Gradients through Acceptance-Rejection Sampling Algorithms
abstract: Variational inference using the reparameterization trick has enabled large-scale
  approximate Bayesian inference in complex probabilistic models, leveraging stochastic
  optimization to sidestep intractable expectations. The reparameterization trick
  is applicable when we can simulate a random variable by applying a differentiable
  deterministic function on an auxiliary random variable whose distribution is fixed.
  For many distributions of interest (such as the gamma or Dirichlet), simulation
  of random variables relies on acceptance-rejection sampling. The discontinuity introduced
  by the accept-reject step means that standard reparameterization tricks are not
  applicable. We propose a new method that lets us leverage reparameterization gradients
  even when variables are outputs of a acceptance-rejection sampling algorithm. Our
  approach enables reparameterization on a larger class of variational distributions.
  In several studies of real and synthetic data, we show that the variance of the
  estimator of the gradient is significantly lower than other state-of-the-art methods.
  This leads to faster convergence of stochastic gradient variational inference.
