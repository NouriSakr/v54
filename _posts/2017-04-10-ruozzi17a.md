title: A Lower Bound on the Partition Function of Attractive Graphical Models in the
  Continuous Case
abstract: Computing the partition function of an arbitrary graphical model is generally
  intractable. As a result, approximate inference techniques such as loopy belief
  propagation and expectation propagation are used to compute an approximation to
  the true partition function.  However, due to general issues of intractability in
  the continuous case, our understanding of these approximations is relatively limited.  In
  particular, a number of theoretical results known for these approximations in the
  discrete case are missing in the continuous case.  In this work, we use graph covers
  to extend several such results from the discrete case to the continuous case.  Specifically,
  we provide a graph cover based upper bound for continuous graphical models, and
  we use this characterization (along with a continuous analog of a discrete correlation-type
  inequality) to show that the Bethe partition function also provides a lower bound
  on the true partition function of attractive graphical models in the continuous
  case.
