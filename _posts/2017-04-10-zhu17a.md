title: Learning Nonparametric Forest Graphical Models with Prior Information
abstract: We present a framework for incorporating prior information into nonparametric
  estimation of graphical models. To avoid distributional assumptions, we restrict
  the graph to be a forest and build on the work of forest density estimation (FDE).
  We reformulate the FDE approach from a Bayesian perspective, and introduce prior
  distributions on the graphs. As two concrete examples, we apply this framework to
  estimating scale-free graphs and learning multiple graphs with similar structures.
  The resulting algorithms are equivalent to finding a maximum spanning tree of a
  weighted graph with a penalty term on the  connectivity pattern of the graph. We
  solve the optimization problem via a minorize-maximization procedure with Kruskalâ€™s
  algorithm. Simulations show that the proposed methods outperform competing parametric
  methods, and are robust to the true data distribution. They also lead to improvement
  in predictive power and interpretability in two real data sets.
