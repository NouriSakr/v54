title: Anomaly Detection in Extreme Regions via Empirical MV-sets on the Sphere
abstract: 'Extreme regions in the feature space are of particular concern for anomaly
  detection: anomalies are likely to be located in the tails, whereas data scarcity
  in such regions makes it difficult to distinguish between large normal instances
  and anomalies. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm for anomaly detection
  in extreme regions. We propose a Minimum Volume set (MV-set) approach relying on
  multivariate extreme value theory. This framework includes a canonical pre-processing
  step, which addresses the issue of output sensitivity to standardization choices.
  The resulting data representation on the sphere highlights the dependence structure
  of the extremal observations. Anomaly detection is then cast as a MV-set estimation
  problem on the sphere, where volume is measured by the spherical measure and mass
  refers to the angular measure. An anomaly then corresponds to an unusual observation
  given that one of its variables is large. A preliminary rate bound analysis is carried
  out for the learning method we introduce and its computational advantages are discussed
  and illustrated by numerical experiments.'
