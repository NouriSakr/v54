title: 'Sketchy Decisions: Convex Low-Rank Matrix Optimization with Optimal Storage'
abstract: This paper concerns a fundamental class of convex matrix optimization problems.
  It presents the first algorithm that uses optimal storage and provably computes
  a low-rank approximation of a solution. In particular, when all solutions have low
  rank, the algorithm converges to a solution. This algorithm, SketchyCGM, modifies
  a standard convex optimization scheme, the conditional gradient method, to store
  only a small randomized sketch of the matrix variable. After the optimization terminates,
  the algorithm extracts a low-rank approximation of the solution from the sketch.
  In contrast to nonconvex heuristics, the guarantees for SketchyCGM do not rely on
  statistical models for the problem data. Numerical work demonstrates the benefits
  of SketchyCGM over heuristics.
