title: 'Conjugate-Computation Variational Inference : Converting Variational Inference
  in Non-Conjugate Models to Inferences in Conjugate Models'
abstract: 'Variational inference is computationally challenging in models that contain
  both conjugate and non-conjugate terms. Methods specifically designed for conjugate
  models, even though computationally efficient, find it difficult to deal with non-conjugate
  terms. On the other hand, stochastic-gradient methods can handle the non-conjugate
  terms but they usually ignore the conjugate structure of the model which might result
  in slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called Conjugate-computation
  Variational Inference (CVI) which brings the best of the two worlds together – it
  uses conjugate computations for the conjugate terms and employs stochastic gradients
  for the rest. We derive this algorithm by using a stochastic mirror-descent method
  in the mean-parameter space, and then expressing each gradient step as a variational
  inference in a conjugate model. We demonstrate our algorithm’s applicability to
  a large class of models and establish its convergence. Our experimental results
  show that our method converges much faster than the methods that ignore the conjugate
  structure of the model. '
