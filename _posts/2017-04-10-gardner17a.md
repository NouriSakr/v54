title: Discovering and Exploiting Additive Structure for Bayesian Optimization
abstract: Bayesian optimization has proven invaluable for black-box optimization of
  expensive functions. Its main limitation is its exponential complexity with respect
  to the dimensionality of the search space using typical kernels. Luckily, many objective
  functions can be decomposed into additive subproblems, which can be optimized independently.
  We investigate how to automatically discover such (typically unknown) additive structure
  while simultaneously exploiting it through Bayesian optimization. We propose an
  efficient algorithm based on Metropolis-Hastings sampling and demonstrate its efficacy
  empirically on synthetic and real-world data sets. Throughout all our experiments
  we reliably discover hidden additive structure whenever it exists and exploit it
  to yield significantly faster convergence.
