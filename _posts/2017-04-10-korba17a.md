title: A Learning Theory of Ranking Aggregation
abstract: Originally formulated in Social Choice theory, Ranking Aggregation, also
  referred to as Consensus Ranking, has motivated the development of numerous statistical
  models since the middle of the 20th century. Recently, the analysis of ranking/preference
  data has been the subject of a renewed interest in machine-learning, boosted by
  modern applications such as meta-search engines, giving rise to the design of various
  scalable algorithmic approaches for approximately computing ranking medians, viewed
  as solutions of a discrete (generally NP-hard) minimization problem. This paper
  develops a statistical learning theory for ranking aggregation in a general probabilistic
  setting (avoiding any rigid ranking model assumptions), assessing the generalization
  ability of empirical ranking medians. Universal rate bounds are established and
  the situations where convergence occurs at an exponential rate are fully characterized.
  Minimax lower bounds are also proved, showing that the rate bounds we obtain are
  optimal.
