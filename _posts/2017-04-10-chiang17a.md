title: Rank Aggregation and Prediction with Item Features
abstract: 'We study the problem of rank aggregation with features, where both pairwise
  comparisons and item features are available to help the rank aggregation task.  Observing
  that traditional rank aggregation methods disregard features, while models adapted
  from learning-to-rank task are sensitive to feature noise, we propose a general
  model to learn a total ranking by balancing between comparisons and feature information
  jointly.  As a result, our proposed model takes advantage of item features and is
  also robust to noise. More importantly, we study the effectiveness of item features
  in our model and show that given sufficiently informative features, the sample complexity
  of our model can be asymptotically lower than models based only on comparisons for
  deriving an $ε$-accurate ranking. The results theoretically justify that our model
  can achieve efficient learning by leveraging item feature information.  In addition,
  we show that the proposed model can also be extended to two other related problems—online
  rank aggregation and rank prediction of new items.  Finally, experiments show that
  our model is more effective and robust compared to existing methods on both synthetic
  and real datasets. '
