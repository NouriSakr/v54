title: Prediction Performance After Learning in Gaussian Process Regression
abstract: This paper considers the quantification of the prediction performance in
  Gaussian process regression. The standard approach is to base the prediction error
  bars on the theoretical predictive variance, which is a lower bound on the mean
  square-error (MSE). This approach, however, does not take into account that the
  statistical model is learned from the data. We show that this omission leads to
  a systematic underestimation of the prediction errors. Starting from a generalization
  of the Cram√©r-Rao bound, we derive a more accurate MSE bound which provides a measure
  of uncertainty for prediction of Gaussian processes. The improved bound is easily
  computed and we illustrate it using synthetic and real data examples.
