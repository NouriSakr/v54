title: Spatial Decompositions for Large Scale SVMs
abstract: 'Although support vector machines (SVMs) are theoretically well understood,
  their underlying optimization problem becomes very expensive if, for example, hundreds
  of thousands of samples and a non-linear kernel are considered. Several approaches
  have been proposed in the past to address this serious limitation. In this work
  we investigate a decomposition strategy that learns on small, spatially defined
  data chunks. Our contributions are two fold: On the theoretical side we establish
  an oracle inequality for the overall learning method using the hinge loss, and show
  that the resulting rates match those known for SVMs solving the complete optimization
  problem with Gaussian kernels. On the practical result we compare our approach to
  learning SVMs on small, randomly chosen chunks. Here it turns out that for comparable
  training times our approach is significantly faster during testing and also reduces
  the test error in most cases significantly. Furthermore, we show that our approach
  easily scales up to 10 million training samples: including hyper-parameter selection
  using cross validation, the entire training only takes a few hours on a single machine.
  Finally, we report an experiment on 32 million training samples. All experiments
  used liquidSVM (Steinwart and Thomann, 2017)'
