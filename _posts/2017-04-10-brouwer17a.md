title: Bayesian Hybrid Matrix Factorisation for Data Integration
abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian hybrid matrix factorisation model (HMF) for
  data integration, based on combining multiple matrix factorisation methods, that
  can be used for in- and out-of-matrix prediction of missing values. The model is
  very general and can be used to integrate many datasets across different entity
  types, including repeated experiments, similarity matrices, and very sparse datasets.
  We apply our method on two biological applications, and extensively compare it to
  state-of-the-art machine learning and matrix factorisation models. For in-matrix
  predictions on drug sensitivity datasets we obtain consistently better performances
  than existing methods. This is especially the case when we increase the sparsity
  of the datasets. Furthermore, we perform out-of-matrix predictions on methylation
  and gene expression datasets, and obtain the best results on two of the three datasets,
  especially when the predictivity of datasets is high.
