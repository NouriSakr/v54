title: Gray-box Inference for Structured Gaussian Process Models
abstract: We develop an automated variational inference method for  Bayesian structured
  prediction problems with Gaussian process (GP) priors and linear-chain likelihoods.  Our
  approach does not  need to know the details of the structured likelihood model and
  can scale up to a large number of observations.  Furthermore, we show that the required
  expected likelihood term and its gradients in the variational objective (ELBO) can
  be estimated efficiently by using expectations over very low-dimensional Gaussian
  distributions. Optimization of the ELBO is fully parallelizable over sequences and
  amenable to stochastic optimization, which we use along with control variate techniques
  to make our framework useful in practice.  Results on a set of natural language
  processing tasks show that our method can be as good as (and sometimes better than,
  in particular with respect to expected log-likelihood)  hard-coded approaches including
  SVM-struct and CRF, and overcomes the scalability limitations of previous inference
  algorithms based on sampling.  Overall, this is a fundamental step to developing
  automated inference methods for Bayesian structured prediction.
