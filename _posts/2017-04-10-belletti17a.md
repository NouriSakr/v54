title: Random projection design for scalable implicit smoothing of randomly observed
  stochastic processes
abstract: Sampling at random timestamps, long range dependencies, and scale hamper
  standard meth- ods for multivariate time series analysis. In this paper we present
  a novel estimator for cross-covariance of randomly observed time series which unravels
  the dynamics of an unobserved stochastic process. We analyze the statistical properties
  of our estimator without needing the assumption that observation timestamps are
  independent from the process of interest and show that our solution is not hindered
  by the issues affecting standard estimators for cross-covariance. We implement and
  evaluate our statistically sound and scalable approach in the distributed setting
  using Apache Spark and demonstrate its ability to unravel causal dynamics on both
  simulations and high-frequency financial trading data.
