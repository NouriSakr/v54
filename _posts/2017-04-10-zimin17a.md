title: Learning Theory for Conditional Risk Minimization
abstract: 'In this work we study the learnability of stochastic processes with respect
  to the conditional risk, i.e. the existence of a learning algorithm that improves
  its next-step performance with the amount of observed data.  We introduce a notion
  of pairwise discrepancy between conditional distributions at different times steps
  and show how certain properties of these discrepancies can be used to construct
  a successful learning algorithm. Our main results are two theorems that establish
  criteria for learnability for many classes of stochastic processes, including all
  special cases studied previously in the literature. '
