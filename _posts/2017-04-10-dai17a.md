title: Learning from Conditional Distributions via Dual Embeddings
abstract: Many machine learning tasks, such as learning with invariance and policy
  evaluation in reinforcement learning, can be characterized as problems of learning
  from conditional distributions. In such problems, each sample x itself is associated
  with a conditional distribution $p(z|x)$ represented by samples $z_i_i=1^M$, and
  the goal is to learn a function f that links these conditional distributions to
  target values y. These problems become very challenging when we only have limited
  samples or in the extreme case only one sample from each conditional distribution.
  Commonly used approaches either assume that z is independent of x, or require an
  overwhelmingly large set of samples from each conditional distribution.   To address
  these challenges, we propose a novel approach which employs a new min-max reformulation
  of the learning from conditional distribution problem.  With such new reformulation,
  we only need to deal with the joint distribution p(z,x). We also design an efficient
  learning algorithm, Embedding-SGD, and establish theoretical sample complexity for
  such problems. Finally, our numerical experiments, on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets, show that the proposed approach can significantly improve over existing
  algorithms.
