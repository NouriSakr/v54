title: Minimax Density Estimation for Growing Dimension
abstract: This paper presents minimax rates for density estimation when the data dimension
  $d$ is allowed to grow with the number of observations $n$ rather than remaining
  fixed as in previous analyses. We prove a non-asymptotic lower bound which gives
  the worst-case rate over standard classes of smooth densities, and we show that
  kernel density estimators achieve this rate. We also give oracle choices for the
  bandwidth and derive the fastest rate $d$ can grow with $n$ to maintain estimation
  consistency.
