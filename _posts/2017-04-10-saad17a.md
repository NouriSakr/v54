title: Detecting Dependencies in Sparse, Multivariate Databases Using Probabilistic
  Programming and Non-parametric Bayes
abstract: Datasets with hundreds of variables and many missing values are commonplace.
  In this setting, it is both statistically and computationally challenging to detect
  true predictive relationships between variables and also to suppress false positives.
  This paper proposes an approach that combines probabilistic programming, information
  theory, and non-parametric Bayes. It shows how to use Bayesian non-parametric modeling
  to (i) build an ensemble of joint probability models for all the variables; (ii)
  efficiently detect marginal independencies; and (iii) estimate the conditional mutual
  information between arbitrary subsets of variables, subject to a broad class of
  constraints. Users can access these capabilities using BayesDB, a probabilistic
  programming platform for probabilistic data analysis, by writing queries in a simple,
  SQL-like language. This paper demonstrates empirically that the method can (i) detect
  context-specific (in)dependencies on challenging synthetic problems and (ii) yield
  improved sensitivity and specificity over baselines from statistics and machine
  learning, on a real-world database of over 300 sparsely observed indicators of macroeconomic
  development and public health.
