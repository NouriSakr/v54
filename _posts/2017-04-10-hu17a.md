title: Gradient Boosting on Stochastic Data Streams
abstract: Boosting is a popular ensemble algorithm that generates more powerful learners
  by linearly combining base models from a simpler hypothesis  class. In this work,
  we investigate the problem of adapting batch gradient boosting  for minimizing convex
  loss functions to online setting where the loss at each iteration is i.i.d sampled
  from an unknown distribution.  To generalize from batch to online, we first introduce
  the definition of online weak learning edge with which for strongly convex and  smooth
  loss functions, we present an algorithm, Streaming Gradient Boosting (SGB) with
  exponential shrinkage guarantees in the number of weak learners. We further present
  an adaptation of SGB to optimize non-smooth  loss functions, for which we derive
  a $O(ln(N)/N)$ convergence rate. We also show that our analysis can extend to adversarial
  online  learning setting under a stronger assumption  that the online weak learning
  edge will hold in adversarial setting. We finally demonstrate  experimental results
  showing that in practice our algorithms can achieve competitive  results as classic
  gradient boosting while using less computation.
