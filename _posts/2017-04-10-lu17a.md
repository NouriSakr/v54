title: A Stochastic Nonconvex Splitting Method for Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
abstract: Symmetric nonnegative matrix factorization (SymNMF) plays an important role
  in applications of many data analytics problems such as community detection, document
  clustering and image segmentation. In this paper, we consider a stochastic SymNMF
  problem in which the observation matrix is generated in a random and sequential
  manner. We propose a stochastic nonconvex splitting method, which not only guarantees
  convergence to the set of stationary points of the problem (in the mean-square sense),
  but further achieves a sublinear convergence rate. Numerical results show that for
  clustering problems over both synthetic and real world datasets, the proposed algorithm
  converges quickly to the set of stationary points.
