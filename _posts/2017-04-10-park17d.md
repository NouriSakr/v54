title: Learning the Network Structure of Heterogeneous Data via Pairwise Exponential
  Markov Random Fields
abstract: Markov random fields (MRFs) are a useful tool for modeling relationships
  present in large and high-dimensional data. Often, this data comes from various
  sources and can have diverse distributions, for example a combination of numerical,
  binary, and categorical variables. Here, we define the pairwise exponential Markov
  random field (PE-MRF), an approach capable of modeling exponential family distributions
  in heterogeneous domains. We develop a scalable method of learning the graphical
  structure across the variables by solving a regularized approximated maximum likelihood
  problem. Specifically, we first derive a tractable upper bound on the log-partition
  function. We then use this upper bound to derive the group graphical lasso, a generalization
  of the classic graphical lasso problem to heterogeneous domains. To solve this problem,
  we develop a fast algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers
  (ADMM). We also prove that our estimator is sparsistent, with guaranteed recovery
  of the true underlying graphical structure, and that it has a polynomially faster
  runtime than the current state-of-the-art method for learning such distributions.
  Experiments on synthetic and real-world examples demonstrate that our approach is
  both efficient and accurate at uncovering the structure of heterogeneous data.
