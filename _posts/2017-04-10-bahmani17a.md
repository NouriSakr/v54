title: 'Phase Retrieval Meets Statistical Learning Theory: A Flexible Convex Relaxation'
abstract: We propose a flexible convex relaxation for the phase retrieval problem
  that operates in the natural domain of the signal. Therefore, we avoid the prohibitive
  computational cost associated with “lifting” and semidefinite programming (SDP)
  in methods such as PhaseLift and compete with recently developed non-convex techniques
  for phase retrieval. We relax the quadratic equations for phaseless measurements
  to inequality constraints each of which representing a symmetric “slab”. Through
  a simple convex program, our proposed estimator finds an extreme point of the intersection
  of these slabs that is best aligned with a given anchor vector. We characterize
  geometric conditions that certify success of the proposed estimator. Furthermore,
  using classic results in statistical learning theory, we show that for random measurements
  the geometric certificates hold with high probability at an optimal sample complexity.
  Phase transition of our estimator is evaluated through simulations. Our numerical
  experiments also suggest that the proposed method can solve phase retrieval problems
  with coded diffraction measurements as well.
