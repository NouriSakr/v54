title: Black-box Importance Sampling
abstract: 'Importance sampling is widely used in machine learning and statistics,
  but its power is limited by the restriction of using simple proposals for which
  the importance weights can be tractably calculated. We address this problem by studying
  black-box importance sampling methods that calculate importance weights for samples
  generated from any unknown proposal or black-box mechanism. Our method allows us
  to use better and richer proposals to solve difficult problems, and (somewhat counter-intuitively)
  also has the additional benefit of improving the estimation accuracy beyond typical
  importance sampling. Both theoretical and empirical analyses are provided. '
