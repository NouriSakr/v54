title: Tensor Decompositions via Two-Mode Higher-Order SVD (HOSVD)
abstract: Tensor decompositions have rich applications in statistics and machine learning,
  and developing efficient, accurate algorithms for the problem has received much
  attention recently. Here, we present a new method built on Kruskalâ€™s uniqueness
  theorem to decompose symmetric, nearly orthogonally decomposable tensors. Unlike
  the classical higher-order singular value decomposition which unfolds a tensor along
  a single mode, we consider unfoldings along two modes and use rank-1 constraints
  to characterize the underlying components. This tensor decomposition method provably
  handles a greater level of noise compared to previous methods and achieves a high
  estimation accuracy. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is robust
  to various noise distributions and that it performs especially favorably as the
  order increases.
