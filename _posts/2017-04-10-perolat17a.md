title: Learning Nash Equilibrium for General-Sum Markov Games from Batch Data
abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning a Nash equilibrium in $γ$-discounted
  multiplayer general-sum Markov Games (MGs) in a batch setting. As the number of
  players increases in MG, the agents may either collaborate or team apart to increase
  their final rewards. One solution to address this problem is to look for a Nash
  equilibrium. Although, several techniques were found for the subcase of two-player
  zero-sum MGs, those techniques fail to find a Nash equilibrium in general-sum Markov
  Games.  In this paper, we introduce a new definition of $ε$-Nash equilibrium in
  MGs which grasps the strategy’s quality for multiplayer games. We prove that minimizing
  the norm of two Bellman-like residuals implies to learn such an $ε$-Nash equilibrium.
  Then, we show that minimizing an empirical estimate of the $L_p$ norm of these Bellman-like
  residuals allows learning for general-sum games within the batch setting. Finally,
  we introduce a neural network architecture that successfully learns a Nash equilibrium
  in generic multiplayer general-sum turn-based MGs.
