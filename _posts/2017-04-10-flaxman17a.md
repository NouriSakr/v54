title: Poisson intensity estimation with reproducing kernels
abstract: 'Despite the fundamental nature of the Poisson process in the theory and
  application of stochastic processes, and its attractive generalizations (e.g. Cox
  process), few tractable nonparametric modeling approaches exist, especially in high
  dimensional settings. In this paper we develop a new, computationally tractable
  Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) formulation for the inhomogeneous Poisson
  process. We model the square root of the intensity as an RKHS function. The modeling
  challenge is that the usual representer theorem arguments no longer apply due to
  the form of the inhomogeneous Poisson process likelihood.  However, we prove that
  the representer theorem does hold in an appropriately transformed RKHS, guaranteeing
  that the optimization of the penalized likelihood can be cast as a tractable finite-dimensional
  problem.  The resulting approach is simple to implement, and readily scales to high
  dimensions and large-scale datasets. '
