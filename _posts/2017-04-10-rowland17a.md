title: Conditions beyond treewidth for tightness of higher-order LP relaxations
abstract: Linear programming (LP) relaxations are a popular method to attempt to find
  a most likely configuration of a discrete graphical model. If a solution to the
  relaxed problem is obtained at an integral vertex then the solution is guaranteed
  to be exact and we say that the relaxation is tight. We consider binary pairwise
  models and introduce new methods which allow us to demonstrate refined conditions
  for tightness of LP relaxations in the Sherali-Adams hierarchy. Our results include
  showing that for higher order LP relaxations, treewidth is not precisely the right
  way to characterize tightness. This work is primarily theoretical, with insights
  that can improve efficiency in practice.
