title: Trading off Rewards and Errors in Multi-Armed Bandits
abstract: In multi-armed bandits, the most common objective is the maximization of
  the cumulative reward. Alternative settings include active exploration, where a
  learner tries to gain accurate estimates of the rewards of all arms. While these
  objectives are contrasting, in many scenarios it is desirable to trade off rewards
  and errors. For instance, in educational games the designer wants to gather generalizable
  knowledge about the behavior of the students and teaching strategies (small estimation
  errors) but, at the same time, the system needs to avoid giving a bad experience
  to the players, who may leave the system permanently (large reward). In this paper,
  we formalize this tradeoff and introduce the ForcingBalance algorithm whose performance
  is provably close to the best possible tradeoff strategy. Finally, we demonstrate
  on real-world educational data that ForcingBalance returns useful information about
  the arms without compromising the overall reward.
