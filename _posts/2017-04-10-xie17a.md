title: Diverse Neural Network Learns True Target Functions
abstract: Neural networks are a powerful class of functions that can be trained with
  simple gradient descent to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of
  applications. Despite their practical success, there is a paucity of results that
  provide theoretical guarantees on why they are so effective.  Lying in the center
  of the problem is the difficulty of analyzing the non-convex loss function with
  potentially numerous local minima and saddle points. Can neural networks corresponding
  to the stationary points of the loss function learn the true target function? If
  yes, what are the key factors contributing to such nice optimization properties?   In
  this paper, we answer these questions by analyzing one-hidden-layer neural networks
  with ReLU activation, and show that despite the non-convexity, neural networks with
  diverse units have no spurious local minima. We bypass the non-convexity issue by
  directly analyzing the first order optimality condition, and show that the loss
  can be made arbitrarily small if the minimum singular value of the “extended feature
  matrix” is large enough. We make novel use of techniques from kernel methods and
  geometric discrepancy, and identify a new relation linking the smallest singular
  value to the spectrum of a kernel function associated with the activation function
  and to the diversity of the units. Our results also suggest a novel regularization
  function to promote unit diversity for potentially better generalization ability.
