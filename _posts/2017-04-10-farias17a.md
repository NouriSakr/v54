title: Optimal Recovery of Tensor Slices
abstract: We consider the problem of large scale matrix recovery given side information
  in the form of additional matrices of conforming dimension. This is a parsimonious
  model that captures a number of interesting problems including context and location
  aware recommendations, personalized ‘tag’ learning, demand learning with side information,
  etc. Viewing the matrix we seek to recover and the side information we have as slices
  of a tensor, we consider the problem of Slice Recovery, which is to recover specific
  slices of a tensor from noisy observations of the tensor. We provide an efficient
  algorithm to recover slices of structurally ’simple’ tensors given noisy observations
  of the tensor’s entries; our definition of simplicity subsumes low-rank tensors
  for a variety of definitions of tensor rank. Our algorithm is practical for large
  datasets and provides a significant performance improvement over state of the art
  incumbent approaches to tensor recovery. We establish theoretical recovery guarantees
  that under reasonable assumptions are minimax optimal for slice recovery. These
  guarantees also imply the first minimax optimal guarantees for recovering tensors
  of low Tucker rank and general noise. Experiments on data from a music streaming
  service demonstrate the performance and scalability of our algorithm.
