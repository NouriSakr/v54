title: Large-Scale Data-Dependent Kernel Approximation
abstract: Learning a computationally efficient kernel from data is an important machine
  learning problem. The majority of kernels in the literature do not leverage the
  geometry of the data, and those that do are computationally infeasible for contemporary
  datasets. Recent advances in approximation techniques have expanded the applicability
  of the kernel methodology to scale linearly with the data size. Data-dependent kernels,
  which could leverage this computational advantage, have however not yet seen the
  benefit. Here we derive an approximate large-scale learning procedure for data-dependent
  kernels that is efficient and performs well in practice. We provide a Lemma that
  can be used to derive the asymptotic convergence of the approximation in the limit
  of infinite random features, and, under certain conditions, an estimate of the convergence
  speed. We empirically prove that our construction represents a valid, yet efficient
  approximation of the data-dependent kernel. For large-scale datasets of millions
  of datapoints, where the proposed method is now applicable for the first time, we
  notice a significant performance boost over both baselines consisting of data independent
  kernels and of kernel approximations, at comparable computational cost.
