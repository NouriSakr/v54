title: 'Contextual Bandits with Latent Confounders: An NMF Approach'
abstract: Motivated by online recommendation and advertising systems, we consider
  a causal model for stochastic contextual bandits with a latent low-dimensional confounder.
  In our model, there are $L$ observed contexts and $K$ arms of the bandit. The observed
  context influences the reward obtained through a latent confounder variable with
  cardinality $m$ ($m ≪L,K$). The arm choice and the latent confounder causally determines
  the reward while the observed context is correlated with the confounder. Under this
  model, the $L \times K$ mean reward matrix $\mathbfU$ (for each context in $[L]$
  and each arm in $[K]$) factorizes into non-negative factors $\mathbfA$ ($L \times
  m$) and  $\mathbfW$ ($m \times K$). This insight enables us to propose an $ε$-greedy
  NMF-Bandit algorithm that designs a sequence of interventions (selecting specific
  arms), that achieves a balance between learning this low-dimensional structure and
  selecting the best arm to minimize regret. Our algorithm achieves a regret of  $\mathcalO\left(L\mathrmpoly(m,
  \log K) \log T \right)$ at time $T$, as compared to $\mathcalO(LK\log T)$ for conventional
  contextual bandits, assuming a constant gap between the best arm and the rest for
  each context. These guarantees are obtained under mild sufficiency conditions on
  the factors that are weaker versions of the well-known Statistical RIP condition.  We
  further propose a class of generative models that satisfy our sufficient conditions,
  and derive a lower bound of $\mathcalO\left(Km\log T\right)$.  These are the first
  regret guarantees for online matrix completion with bandit feedback, when the rank
  is greater than one.  We further compare the performance of our algorithm with the
  state of the art, on synthetic and real world data-sets.
