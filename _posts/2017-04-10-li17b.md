title: Efficient Rank Aggregation via Lehmer Codes
abstract: 'We propose a novel rank aggregation method based on converting permutations
  into their  corresponding Lehmer codes or other subdiagonal images. Lehmer codes,
  also known as inversion vectors, are vector representations of permutations in which
  each coordinate can take values not restricted by the values of other coordinates.
  This transformation allows for decoupling of the coordinates and for performing
  aggregation via simple scalar median or mode computations. We present simulation
  results illustrating the performance of this completely parallelizable approach
  and analytically prove that both the mode and median aggregation procedure recover
  the correct centroid aggregate with small sample complexity when the permutations
  are drawn according to the well-known Mallows models. The proposed Lehmer code approach
  may also be used on partial rankings, with similar performance guarantees.  '
