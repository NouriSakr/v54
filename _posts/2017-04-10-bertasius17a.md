title: Local Perturb-and-MAP for Structured Prediction
abstract: 'Conditional random fields (CRFs) provide a powerful tool for structured
  prediction, but cast significant challenges in both the learning and inference steps.
  Approximation techniques are widely used in both steps, which should be considered
  jointly to guarantee good performance (a.k.a. “inferning"). Perturb-and-MAP models
  provide a promising alternative to CRFs, but require global combinatorial optimization
  and hence they are usable only on specific models. In this work, we present a new
  Local Perturb-and-MAP (locPMAP) framework that replaces the global optimization
  with a local optimization by exploiting our observed connection between locPMAP
  and the pseudolikelihood of the original CRF model. We test our approach on three
  different vision tasks and show that our method achieves consistently improved performance
  over other approximate inference techniques optimized to a pseudolikelihood objective.  Additionally,
  we demonstrate that we can integrate our method in the fully convolutional network
  framework to increase our model’s complexity. Finally, our observed connection between
  locPMAP and the pseudolikelihood leads to a novel perspective for understanding
  and using pseudolikelihood. '
