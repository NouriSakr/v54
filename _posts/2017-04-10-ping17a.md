title: Belief Propagation in Conditional RBMs for Structured Prediction
abstract: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and conditional RBMs (CRBMs) are popular
  models for a wide range of applications.  In previous work, learning on such models
  has been dominated by contrastive divergence (CD) and its variants.  Belief propagation (BP)
  algorithms are believed to be slow for structured prediction on conditional RBMs (e.g.,
  Mnih et al. [2011]), and not as good as CD when applied in learning (e.g., Larochelle
  et al. [2012]).  In this work, we present a matrix-based implementation of belief
  propagation algorithms on CRBMs, which is easily scalable to tens of thousands of
  visible and hidden units.  We demonstrate that, in both maximum likelihood and max-margin
  learning, training conditional RBMs with BP as the inference routine can provide
  significantly better results than current state-of-the-art CD methods on structured
  prediction problems.  We also include practical guidelines on training CRBMs with
  BP, and some insights on the interaction of learning and inference algorithms for
  CRBMs.
