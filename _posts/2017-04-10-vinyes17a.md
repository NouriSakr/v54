title: Fast column generation for atomic norm regularization
abstract: We consider optimization problems that consist in minimizing a quadratic
  function under an atomic norm regularization or constraint. In the line of work
  on conditional gradient algorithms, we show that the fully corrective Frank-Wolfe
  (FCFW) algorithm — which is most naturally reformulated as a column generation algorithm
  in the regularized case — can be made particularly efficient for difficult problems
  in this family by solving the simplicial or conical subproblems produced by FCFW
  using a special instance of a classical  active set algorithm for quadratic programming
  that generalizes the min-norm point algorithm.
