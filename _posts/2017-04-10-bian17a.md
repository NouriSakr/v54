title: 'Guaranteed Non-convex Optimization: Submodular Maximization over Continuous
  Domains'
abstract: Submodular continuous functions are a category of (generally) non-convex/non-concave
  functions with a wide spectrum of applications. We characterize these functions
  and demonstrate that they can be maximized efficiently with approximation guarantees.
  Specifically, i) We introduce  the weak DR property that gives a unified characterization
  of submodularity for all  set, integer-lattice and continuous functions; ii) for
  maximizing monotone DR-submodular continuous functions under general down-closed
  convex constraints, we propose a Frank-Wolfe variant with (1-1/e) approximation
  guarantee, and sub-linear convergence rate; iii) for maximizing general non-monotone
  submodular continuous functions subject to box constraints, we propose a DoubleGreedy
  algorithm with 1/3 approximation guarantee. Submodular continuous functions naturally
  find applications in various real-world settings, including influence and revenue
  maximization with continuous assignments, sensor energy management, facility location,
  etc.  Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms efficiently generate
  superior solutions  compared to baseline algorithms.
