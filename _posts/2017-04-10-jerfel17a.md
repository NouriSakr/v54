title: Dynamic Collaborative Filtering With Compound Poisson Factorization
abstract: 'Model-based collaborative filtering (CF) analyzes userâ€“item interactions
  to infer latent factors that represent user preferences and item characteristics
  in order to predict future interactions. Most CF approaches assume that these latent
  factors are static; however, in most CF data, user preferences and item perceptions
  drift over time. Here, we propose a new conjugate and numerically stable dynamic
  matrix factorization (DCPF) based on hierarchical Poisson factorization that models
  the smoothly drifting latent factors using gamma-Markov chains. We propose a conjugate
  gamma chain construction that is numerically stable within our compound-Poisson
  framework. We then derive a scalable stochastic variational inference approach to
  estimate the parameters of our model. We apply our model to time-stamped ratings
  data sets from Netflix, Yelp, and Last.fm. We empirically demonstrate that DCPF
  achieves a higher predictive accuracy than state-of-the-art static and dynamic factorization
  algorithms. '
