title: Decentralized Collaborative Learning of Personalized Models over Networks
abstract: 'We consider a set of learning agents in a collaborative peer-to-peer network,
  where each agent learns a personalized model according to its own learning objective.
  The question addressed in this paper is: how can agents improve upon their locally
  trained model by communicating with other agents that have similar objectives? We
  introduce and analyze two asynchronous gossip algorithms running in a fully decentralized
  manner. Our first approach, inspired from label propagation, aims to smooth pre-trained
  local models over the network while accounting for the confidence that each agent
  has in its initial model. In our second approach, agents jointly learn and propagate
  their model by making iterative updates based on both their local dataset and the
  behavior of their neighbors. To optimize this challenging objective, our decentralized
  algorithm is based on ADMM.'
