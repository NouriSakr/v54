title: 'Relativistic Monte Carlo '
abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  algorithm that generates proposals for a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm by simulating
  the dynamics of a Hamiltonian system. However, HMC is sensitive to large time discretizations
  and performs poorly if there is a mismatch between the spatial geometry of the target
  distribution and the scales of the momentum distribution. In particular the mass
  matrix of HMC is hard to tune well. In order to alleviate these problems we propose
  relativistic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, a version of HMC based on relativistic dynamics
  that introduces a maximum velocity on particles. We also derive stochastic gradient
  versions of the algorithm and show that the resulting algorithms bear interesting
  relationships to gradient clipping, RMSprop, Adagrad and Adam, popular optimisation
  methods in deep learning. Based on this, we develop relativistic stochastic gradient
  descent by taking the zero-temperature limit of relativistic stochastic gradient
  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In experiments we show that the relativistic algorithms
  perform better than classical Newtonian variants and Adam.
