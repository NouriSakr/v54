title: 'Learning with Feature Feedback: from Theory to Practice'
abstract: In supervised learning, a human annotator only needs to assign each data
  point (document, image, etc.) its correct label. But in many situations, the human
  can also provide richer feedback at essentially no extra cost. In this paper, we
  examine a particular type of feature feedback that has been used, with some success,
  in information retrieval and in computer vision. We formalize two models of feature
  feedback, give learning algorithms for them, and quantify their usefulness in the
  learning process. Our experiments also show the efficacy of these methods.
