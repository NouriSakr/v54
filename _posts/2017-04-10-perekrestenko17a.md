title: Faster Coordinate Descent via Adaptive Importance Sampling
abstract: 'Coordinate descent methods employ random partial updates of decision variables
  in order to solve huge-scale convex optimization problems. In this work, we introduce
  new adaptive rules for the random selection of their updates. By adaptive, we mean
  that our selection rules are based on the dual residual or the primal-dual gap estimates
  and can change at each iteration. We theoretically characterize the performance
  of our selection rules and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art, and
  extend our theory and algorithms to general convex objectives. Numerical evidence
  with hinge-loss support vector machines and Lasso confirm that the practice follows
  the theory. '
