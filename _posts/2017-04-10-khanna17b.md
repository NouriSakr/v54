title: Scalable Greedy Feature Selection via Weak Submodularity
abstract: 'Greedy algorithms are widely used for problems in machine learning such
  as feature selection and set function optimization.  Unfortunately, for large datasets,
  the running time of even greedy algorithms can be quite high.  This is because for
  each greedy step we need to refit a model or calculate a function using the previously
  selected choices and the new candidate.   Two algorithms that are faster approximations
  to the greedy forward selection were introduced recentlyÂ [Mirzasoleiman et al.,
  2013, 2015]. They achieve better performance by exploiting stochastic evaluation
  and distributed computation respectively. Both algorithms have provable performance
  guarantees for submodular functions.  In this paper we show that divergent from
  previously held opinion, submodularity is not required to obtain approximation guarantees
  for these two algorithms. Specifically, we show that a generalized concept of weak
  submodularity suffices to give multiplicative approximation guarantees. Our result
  extends the applicability of these algorithms to a larger class of functions. Furthermore,
  we show that a bounded submodularity ratio can be used to provide data dependent
  bounds that can sometimes be tighter also for submodular functions. We empirically
  validate our work by showing superior performance of fast greedy approximations
  versus several established baselines on artificial and real datasets. '
