title: Comparison-Based Nearest Neighbor Search
abstract: We consider machine learning in a comparison-based setting where we are
  given a set of points in a metric space, but we have no access to the actual distances
  between the points. Instead, we can only ask an oracle whether the distance between
  two points i and j is smaller than the distance between the points i and k. We are
  concerned with data structures and algorithms to find nearest neighbors based on
  such comparisons. We focus on a simple yet effective algorithm that recursively
  splits the space by first selecting two random pivot points and then assigning all
  other points to the closer of the two (comparison tree). We prove that if the metric
  space satisfies certain expansion conditions, then with high probability the height
  of the comparison tree is logarithmic in the number of points, leading to efficient
  search performance. We also provide an upper bound for the failure  probability
  to return the true nearest neighbor. Experiments show that the comparison tree is
  competitive with algorithms that have access to the actual distance values, and
  needs less triplet comparisons than other competitors.
