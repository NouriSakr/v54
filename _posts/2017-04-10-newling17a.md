title: A Sub-Quadratic Exact Medoid Algorithm
abstract: 'We present a new algorithm, ‘trimed’ for obtaining the medoid of a set,
  that is the element of the set which minimises the mean distance to all other elements.
  The algorithm is shown to have, under certain assumptions, expected run time $O(N^(3/2))$
  in $R^d$ where N is the set size, making it the first sub-quadratic exact medoid
  algorithm for $d > 1$. Experiments show that it performs very well on spatial network
  data, frequently requiring two orders of magnitude fewer distance calculations than
  state-of-the-art approximate algorithms. As an application, we show how trimed can
  be used as a component in an accelerated K-medoids algorithm, and then how it can
  be relaxed to obtain further computational gains with only a minor loss in cluster
  quality.  '
