title: Frank-Wolfe Algorithms for Saddle Point Problems
abstract: We extend the Frank-Wolfe (FW) optimization algorithm to solve constrained
  smooth convex-concave saddle point (SP) problems. Remarkably, the method only requires
  access to linear minimization oracles. Leveraging recent advances in FW optimization,
  we provide the first proof of convergence of a FW-type saddle point solver over
  polytopes, thereby partially answering a 30 year-old conjecture. We also survey
  other convergence results and highlight gaps in the theoretical underpinnings of
  FW-style algorithms. Motivating applications without known efficient alternatives
  are explored through structured prediction with combinatorial penalties as well
  as games over matching polytopes involving an exponential number of constraints.
