title: Improved Strongly Adaptive Online Learning using Coin Betting
abstract: 'This paper describes a new parameter-free online learning algorithm for
  changing environments.  In comparing against algorithms with the same time complexity
  as ours, we obtain a strongly adaptive regret bound that is a factor of at least
  $\sqrt\log(T)$ better, where $T$ is the time horizon.  Empirical results show that
  our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in learning with expert advice
  and metric learning scenarios.   '
