title: Unsupervised Sequential Sensor Acquisition
abstract: In many security and healthcare systems a sequence of sensors/tests are
  used for detection and diagnosis. Each test outputs a prediction of the latent state,
  and carries with it inherent costs. Our objective is to learn strategies for selecting
  tests to optimize accuracy and costs. Unfortunately it is often impossible to acquire
  in-situ ground truth annotations and we are left with the problem of unsupervised
  sensor selection (USS). We pose USS as a version of stochastic partial monitoring
  problem with an unusual reward structure (even noisy annotations are unavailable).
  Unsurprisingly no learner can achieve sublinear regret without further assumptions.
  To this end we propose the notion of weak-dominance. This is a condition on the
  joint probability distribution of test outputs and latent state and says that whenever
  a test is accurate on an example, a later test in the sequence is likely to be accurate
  as well.
