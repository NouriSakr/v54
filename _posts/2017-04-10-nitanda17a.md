title: Stochastic Difference of Convex Algorithm and its Application to Training Deep
  Boltzmann Machines
abstract: Difference of convex functions (DC) programming is an important approach
  to nonconvex optimization problems because these structures can be encountered in
  several fields. Effective optimization methods, called DC algorithms, have been
  developed in deterministic optimization literature. In machine learning, a lot of
  important learning problems such as the Boltzmann machines (BMs) can be formulated
  as DC programming. However, there is no DC-like algorithm guaranteed by convergence
  rate analysis for stochastic problems that are more suitable settings for machine
  learning tasks.  In this paper, we propose a stochastic variant of DC algorithm
  and give computational complexities to converge to a stationary point under several
  situations. Moreover, we show our method includes expectation-maximization (EM)
  and Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm as special cases on training BMs. In other words,
  we extend EM/MCEM algorithm to more effective methods from DC viewpoint with theoretical
  convergence guarantees. Experimental results indicate that our method performs well
  for training binary restricted Boltzmann machines and deep Boltzmann machines without
  pre-training.
