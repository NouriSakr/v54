title: Information Projection and Approximate Inference for Structured Sparse Variables
abstract: Approximate inference via information projection has been recently introduced
  as a general-purpose technique  for efficient probabilistic inference given sparse
  variables. This manuscript goes beyond classical sparsity by proposing efficient
  algorithms for approximate inference via information projection that are applicable
  to any structure on the set of variables that admits enumeration using matroid or
  knapsack constraints.  Further, leveraging recent advances in submodular optimization,
  we provide an efficient greedy algorithm with strong optimization-theoretic guarantees.
  The class of probabilistic models that can be expressed in this way is quite broad
  and, as we show, includes group sparse regression, group sparse principal components
  analysis and sparse collective matrix factorization, among others. Empirical results
  on simulated data and high dimensional neuroimaging data  highlight the superior
  performance of the information projection approach as compared to established baselines
  for a range of probabilistic models.
