title: Binary and Multi-Bit Coding for Stable Random Projections
abstract: The recent work [17] developed a 1-bit compressed sensing (CS) algorithm
  based on $α$-stable random projections. Although the work in [17] showed that the
  method is a strong competitor of other existing 1-bit algorithms, the procedure
  requires knowing $K$, the sparsity. Note that $K$ is the $l_0$ norm of the signal.
  Other existing  1-bit CS algorithms require  the $l_2$ norm of the signal.  In this
  paper, we develop an estimation procedure for the $l_α$ norm of the signal, where
  $0<α\leq2$ from binary or multi-bit measurements. We demonstrate that using a  simple
  closed-form estimator with merely 1-bit information does not result in a significant
  loss of accuracy if the parameter is chosen appropriately.  Theoretical tail bounds
  are  also provided. Using 2 or more bits  per measurement reduces the variance and  importantly,
  stabilizes the estimate so that  the  variance is not too sensitive to chosen parameters.
