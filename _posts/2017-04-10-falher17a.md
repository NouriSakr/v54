title: On the Troll-Trust Model for Edge Sign Prediction in Social Networks
abstract: In the problem of edge sign prediction, we are given a directed graph (representing
  a social network), and our task is to predict the binary labels of the edges (i.e.,
  the positive or negative nature of the social relationships). Many successful heuristics
  for this problem are based on the troll-trust features, estimating at each node
  the fraction of outgoing and incoming positive/negative edges. We show that these
  heuristics can be understood, and rigorously analyzed, as approximators to the Bayes
  optimal classifier for a simple probabilistic model of the edge labels. We then
  show that the maximum likelihood estimator for this model approximately corresponds
  to the predictions of a Label Propagation algorithm run on a transformed version
  of the original social graph. Extensive experiments on a number of real-world datasets
  show that this algorithm is competitive against state-of-the-art classifiers in
  terms of both accuracy and scalability. Finally, we show that troll-trust features
  can also be used to derive online learning algorithms which have theoretical guarantees
  even when edges are adversarially labeled.
