title: Distribution of Gaussian Process Arc Lengths
abstract: "   We present the first treatment of the arc length of the GP with more
  than a single output dimension. GPs are commonly used for tasks such as trajectory
  modelling, where path length is a crucial quantity of interest. Previously, only
  paths in one dimension have been considered, with no theoretical consideration of
  higher dimensional problems.  We fill the gap in the existing literature by deriving
  the moments of the arc length for a stationary GP with multiple output dimensions.
  A new method is used to derive the mean of a one-dimensional GP over a finite interval,
  by considering the distribution of the arc length integrand. This technique is used
  to derive an approximate distribution over the arc length of a vector valued GP
  in $\\mathbbR^n$ by moment matching the distribution. Numerical simulations confirm
  our theoretical derivations."
