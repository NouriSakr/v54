title: Minimax Approach to Variable Fidelity Data Interpolation
abstract: 'Engineering problems often involve data sources of variable fidelity with
  different costs of obtaining an observation.  In particular, one can use both a
  cheap low fidelity function (e.g. a computational experiment with a CFD code) and
  an expensive high fidelity function (e.g. a wind tunnel experiment) to generate
  a data sample in order to construct a regression model of a high fidelity function.
  The key question in this setting is how the sizes of the high and low fidelity data
  samples should be selected in order to stay within a given computational budget
  and maximize accuracy of the regression model prior to committing resources on data
  acquisition.   In this paper we obtain minimax interpolation errors for single and
  variable fidelity scenarios for a multivariate Gaussian process regression. Evaluation
  of the minimax errors allows us to identify cases when the variable fidelity data
  provides better interpolation accuracy than the exclusively high fidelity data for
  the same computational budget. These results allow us to calculate the optimal shares
  of variable fidelity data samples under the given computational budget constraint.
  Real and synthetic data experiments suggest that using the obtained optimal shares
  often outperforms natural heuristics in terms of the regression accuracy. '
