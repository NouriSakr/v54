title: A Maximum Matching Algorithm for Basis Selection in Spectral Learning
abstract: 'We present a solution to scale spectral algorithms for learning sequence
  functions.  We are interested in the case where these functions are sparse (that
  is, for most sequences they return 0). Spectral algorithms reduce the learning problem
  to the task of computing an SVD decomposition over a special type of matrix called
  the Hankel matrix. This matrix is designed to capture the relevant statistics of
  the training sequences. What is crucial is that to capture long range dependencies
  we must consider very large Hankel matrices. Thus the computation of the SVD becomes
  a critical bottleneck. Our solution finds a subset of rows and columns of the Hankel
  that realizes a compact and informative Hankel submatrix. The novelty lies in the
  way that this subset is selected: we exploit a maximal bipartite matching combinatorial
  algorithm to look for a sub-block with full structural rank, and show how computation
  of this sub-block can be further improved by exploiting the specific structure of
  Hankel matrices.'
