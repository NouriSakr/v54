title: A Unified Computational and Statistical Framework for Nonconvex Low-rank Matrix
  Estimation
abstract: 'We propose a unified framework for estimating low-rank matrices through
  nonconvex optimization based on gradient descent algorithm. Our framework is quite
  general and can be applied to both noisy and noiseless observations. In the general
  case with noisy observations, we show that our algorithm is guaranteed to linearly
  converge to the unknown low-rank matrix up to a minimax optimal statistical error,
  provided an appropriate initial estimator. While in the generic noiseless setting,
  our algorithm converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate and enables
  exact recovery with optimal sample complexity. In addition, we develop a new initialization
  algorithm to provide the desired initial estimator, which outperforms existing initialization
  algorithms for nonconvex low-rank matrix estimation. We illustrate the superiority
  of our framework through three examples: matrix regression, matrix completion, and
  one-bit matrix completion. We also corroborate our theory through extensive experiments
  on synthetic data.'
