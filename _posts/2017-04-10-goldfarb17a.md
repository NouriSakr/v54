title: Linear Convergence of Stochastic Frank Wolfe Variants
abstract: In this paper, we show that the Away-step Stochastic Frank-Wolfe (ASFW)
  and Pairwise Stochastic Frank-Wolfe (PSFW) algorithms converge linearly in expectation.
  We also show that if an algorithm convergences linearly in expectation then it converges
  linearly almost surely. In order to prove these results, we develop a novel proof
  technique based on concepts of empirical processes and concentration inequalities.
  As far as we know, this technique has not been used previously to derive the convergence
  rates of stochastic optimization algorithms. In large- scale numerical experiments,
  ASFW and PSFW perform as well as or better than their stochastic competitors in
  actual CPU time.
