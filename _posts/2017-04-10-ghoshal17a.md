title: Information-theoretic limits of Bayesian network structure learning
abstract: In this paper, we study the information-theoretic limits of learning the
  structure of Bayesian networks (BNs), on discrete as well as continuous random variables,
  from a finite number of samples. We show that the minimum number of samples required
  by any procedure to recover the correct structure grows as $Ω(m)$ and $Ω(k \log
  m + (k^2)/m)$ for non-sparse and sparse BNs respectively, where m is the number
  of variables and k is the maximum number of parents per node. We provide a simple
  recipe, based on an extension of the Fano’s inequality, to obtain information-theoretic
  limits of structure recovery for any exponential family BN. We instantiate our result
  for specific conditional distributions in the exponential family to characterize
  the fundamental limits of learning various commonly used BNs, such as conditional
  probability table based networks, Gaussian BNs, noisy-OR networks, and logistic
  regression networks. En route to obtaining our main results, we obtain tight bounds
  on the number of sparse and non-sparse essential-DAGs. Finally, as a byproduct,
  we recover the information-theoretic limits of sparse variable selection for logistic
  regression.
