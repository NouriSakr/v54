title: Optimistic Planning for the Stochastic Knapsack Problem
abstract: The stochastic knapsack problem is a stochastic resource allocation problem
  that arises frequently and yet is exceptionally hard to solve. We derive and study
  an optimistic planning algorithm specifically designed for the stochastic knapsack
  problem. Unlike other optimistic planning algorithms for MDPs, our algorithm, OpStoK,
  avoids the use of discounting and is adaptive to the amount of resources available.
  We achieve this behavior by means of a concentration inequality that simultaneously
  applies to capacity and reward estimates. Crucially, we are able to guarantee that
  the aforementioned confidence regions hold collectively over all time steps by an
  application of Doob’s inequality. We demonstrate that the method returns an $ε$-optimal
  solution to the stochastic knapsack problem with high probability. To the best of
  our knowledge, our algorithm is the first which provides such guarantees for the
  stochastic knapsack problem. Furthermore, our algorithm is an anytime algorithm
  and will return a good solution even if stopped prematurely. This is particularly
  important given the difficulty of the problem. We also provide theoretical conditions
  to guarantee OpStoK does not expand all policies and demonstrate favorable performance
  in a simple experimental setting.
