title: 'Sketching Meets Random Projection in the Dual: A Provable Recovery Algorithm
  for Big and High-dimensional Data'
abstract: Sketching techniques scale up machine learning algorithms by reducing the
  sample size or dimensionality of massive data sets, without sacrificing their statistical
  properties. In this paper, we study sketching from an optimization point of view.
  We first show that the iterative Hessian sketch is an optimization process with
  \emphpreconditioning and develop an \emphaccelerated version using this insight
  together with conjugate gradient descent. Next, we establish a primal-dual connection
  between the Hessian sketch and dual random projection, which allows us to develop
  an \emphaccelerated iterative dual random projection method by applying the preconditioned
  conjugate gradient descent on the dual problem. Finally, we tackle the problems
  of large sample size and high-dimensionality in massive data sets by developing
  the \emphprimal-dual sketch.  The primal-dual sketch iteratively sketches the primal
  and dual formulations and requires only a logarithmic number of calls to solvers
  of small sub-problems to recover the optimum of the original problem up to \empharbitrary
  precision. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets complement our
  theoretical results.
