title: A Fast and Scalable Joint Estimator for Learning Multiple Related Sparse Gaussian
  Graphical Models
abstract: 'Estimating multiple sparse Gaussian Graphical Models (sGGMs) jointly for
  many related tasks (large $K$) under a high-dimensional (large $p$) situation is
  an important task. Most previous studies for the joint estimation of multiple sGGMs
  rely on penalized log-likelihood estimators that involve expensive and difficult
  non-smooth optimizations. We propose a novel approach, FASJEM for \underlinefast
  and \underlinescalable \underlinejoint structure-\underlineestimation of \underlinemultiple
  sGGMs at a large scale. As the first study of joint sGGM using the M-estimator framework,
  our work has three major contributions: (1) We solve FASJEM through an entry-wise
  manner which is parallelizable. (2) We choose a proximal algorithm to optimize FASJEM.
  This improves the computational efficiency from $O(Kp^3)$ to $O(Kp^2)$ and reduces
  the memory requirement from $O(Kp^2)$ to $O(K)$. (3) We theoretically prove that
  FASJEM achieves a consistent estimation with a convergence rate of $O(\log(Kp)/n_tot)$.
  On several synthetic and four real-world datasets, FASJEM shows significant improvements
  over baselines on accuracy, computational complexity and memory costs.'
