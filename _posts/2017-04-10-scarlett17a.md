title: Lower Bounds on Active Learning for Graphical Model Selection
abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the underlying graph associated with
  a Markov random field, with the added twist that the decoding algorithm can iteratively
  choose which subsets of nodes to sample based on the previous samples, resulting
  in an active learning setting.  Considering both Ising and Gaussian models, we provide
  algorithm-independent lower bounds for high-probability recovery within the class
  of degree-bounded graphs.  Our main results are minimax lower bounds for the active
  setting that match the best known lower bounds for the passive setting, which in
  turn are known to be tight in several cases of interest.     Our analysis is based
  on Fanoâ€™s inequality, along with novel mutual information bounds for the active
  learning setting, and the application of restricted graph ensembles.  While we consider
  ensembles that are similar or identical to those used in the passive setting, we
  require different analysis techniques, with a key challenge being bounding a mutual
  information quantity associated with observed subsets of nodes, as opposed to full
  observations.
