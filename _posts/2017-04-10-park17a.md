title: Non-square matrix sensing without spurious local minima via the Burer-Monteiro
  approach
abstract: 'We consider the non-square matrix sensing problem, under restricted isometry
  property (RIP) assumptions.  We focus on the non-convex formulation, where any rank-r
  matrix $X ∈R^m x n$ is represented as $UV^T$, where $U ∈R^m x r$ and $V ∈R^n x r$.
  In this paper, we complement recent findings on the non-convex geometry of the analogous
  PSD setting [5], and show that matrix factorization does not introduce any spurious
  local minima, under RIP. '
