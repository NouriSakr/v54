title: Non-Count Symmetries in Boolean & Multi-Valued Prob. Graphical Models
abstract: Lifted inference algorithms commonly exploit symmetries in a probabilistic
  graphical model (PGM) for efficient inference.  However, existing algorithms for
  Boolean-valued domains can identify only those pairs of states as symmetric, in
  which the number of ones and zeros match exactly (count symmetries). Moreover,  algorithms
  for lifted inference in multi-valued domains also compute a multi-valued extension
  of count symmetries only. These algorithms miss many symmetries in a domain.  In
  this paper, we present first algorithms to compute non-count symmetries in both
  Boolean-valued and multi-valued domains. Our methods can also find symmetries between
  multi-valued variables that have different domain cardinalities.  The key insight
  in the algorithms is that they change the unit of symmetry computation from a variable
  to a variable-value (VV) pair.  Our experiments find that exploiting these symmetries
  in MCMC  can obtain substantial computational gains over existing algorithms.
