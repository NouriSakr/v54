title: Minimax-optimal semi-supervised regression on unknown manifolds
abstract: 'We consider semi-supervised regression when the predictor variables are
  drawn from an unknown manifold. A simple two step approach to this problem is to:
  (i) estimate the manifold geodesic distance between any pair of points using both
  the labeled and unlabeled instances; and (ii) apply a k nearest neighbor regressor
  based on these distance estimates. We prove that given sufficiently many unlabeled
  points, this simple method of geodesic kNN regression achieves the optimal finite-sample
  minimax bound on the mean squared error, as if the manifold were known. Furthermore,
  we show how this approach can be efficiently implemented, requiring only O(k N log
  N) operations to estimate the regression function at all N labeled and unlabeled
  points. We illustrate this approach on two datasets with a manifold structure: indoor
  localization using WiFi fingerprints and facial pose estimation. In both cases,
  geodesic kNN is more accurate and much faster than the popular Laplacian eigenvector
  regressor.'
