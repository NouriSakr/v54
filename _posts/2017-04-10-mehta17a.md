title: Fast rates with high probability in exp-concave statistical learning
abstract: We present an algorithm for the statistical learning setting with a bounded
  exp-concave loss in d dimensions that obtains excess risk $O(d \log(1/δ)/n)$ with
  probability $1 - δ$. The core technique is to boost the confidence of recent in-expectation
  O(d/n) excess risk bounds for empirical risk minimization (ERM), without sacrificing
  the rate, by leveraging a Bernstein condition which holds due to exp-concavity.  We
  also show that a regret bound for any online learner in this setting translates
  to a high probability excess risk bound for the corresponding online-to-batch conversion
  of the online learner.  Lastly, we present high probability bounds for the exp-concave
  model selection aggregation problem that are quantile-adaptive in a certain sense.
  One bound obtains a nearly optimal rate without requiring the loss to be Lipschitz
  continuous, and another requires Lipschitz continuity but obtains the optimal rate.
