title: Quantifying the accuracy of approximate diffusions and Markov chains
abstract: 'Markov chains and diffusion processes are indispensable tools in machine
  learning and statistics that are used for inference, sampling, and modeling. With
  the growth of large-scale datasets, the computational cost associated with simulating
  these stochastic processes can be considerable, and many algorithms have been proposed
  to approximate the underlying Markov chain or diffusion. A fundamental question
  is how the computational savings trade off against the statistical error incurred
  due to approximations. This paper develops general results that address this question.
  We bound the Wasserstein distance between the equilibrium distributions of two diffusions
  as a function of their mixing rates and the deviation in their drifts. We show that
  this error bound is tight in simple Gaussian settings. Our general result on continuous
  diffusions can be discretized to provide insights into the computationalâ€“statistical
  trade-off of Markov chains. As an illustration, we apply our framework to derive
  finite-sample error bounds of approximate unadjusted Langevin dynamics. We characterize
  computation-constrained settings where, by using fast-to-compute approximate gradients
  in the Langevin dynamics, we obtain more accurate samples compared to using the
  exact gradients. Finally, as an additional application of our approach, we quantify
  the accuracy of approximate zig-zag sampling. Our theoretical analyses are supported
  by simulation experiments. '
