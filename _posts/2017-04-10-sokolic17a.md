title: Generalization Error of Invariant Classifiers
abstract: This paper studies the generalization error of invariant classifiers. In
  particular, we consider the common scenario where  the classification task is invariant
  to certain transformations of the input, and that the classifier is constructed
  (or learned) to be invariant to these transformations. Our approach relies on factoring
  the input space into a product of a base space and a set of transformations. We
  show that whereas the generalization error of a non-invariant classifier is proportional
  to the complexity of the input space, the generalization error of an invariant classifier
  is proportional to the complexity of the base space. We also derive a set of sufficient
  conditions on the geometry of the base space and the set of transformations that
  ensure that the complexity of the base space is much smaller than the complexity
  of the input space. Our analysis applies to general classifiers such as convolutional
  neural networks. We demonstrate the implications of the developed theory for such
  classifiers with experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
