title: Nonlinear ICA of Temporally Dependent Stationary Sources
abstract: We develop a nonlinear generalization of independent component analysis
  (ICA) or blind source separation, based on temporal dependencies (e.g. autocorrelations).
  We introduce a nonlinear generative model where the independent sources are assumed
  to be temporally dependent, non-Gaussian, and stationary, and we observe arbitrarily
  nonlinear mixtures of them. We develop a method for estimating the model (i.e. separating
  the sources) based on logistic regression in a neural network which learns to discriminate
  between a short temporal window of the data vs. a temporal window of temporally
  permuted data. We prove that the method estimates the sources for general smooth
  mixing nonlinearities, assuming the sources have sufficiently strong temporal dependencies,
  and these dependencies are in a certain way different from dependencies found in
  Gaussian processes. For Gaussian (and similar) sources, the method estimates the
  nonlinear part of the mixing. We thus provide the first rigorous and general proof
  of identifiability of nonlinear ICA for temporally dependent sources, together with
  a practical method for its estimation.
