title: Linking Micro Event History to Macro Prediction in Point Process Models
abstract: User behaviors in social networks are microscopic with fine grained temporal
  information. Predicting a macroscopic quantity based on usersâ€™ collective behaviors
  is an important problem. However, existing works are mainly problem-specific models
  for the microscopic behaviors and typically design approximation or heuristic algorithms
  to compute the macroscopic quantity. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework
  with a jump stochastic differential equation model that systematically links the
  microscopic event data and macroscopic inference, and the theory to approximate
  its probability distribution. We showed that our method can better predict the user
  behaviors in real-world applications.
