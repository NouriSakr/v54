title: Scalable variational inference for super resolution microscopy
abstract: Super-resolution microscopy methods have become essential tools in biology,
  opening up a variety of new questions that were previously inaccessible with standard
  light microscopy methods. In this paper we develop new Bayesian image processing
  methods that extend the reach of super-resolution microscopy even further. Our method
  couples variational inference techniques with a data summarization based on Laplace
  approximation to ensure computational scalability. Our formulation makes it straightforward
  to incorporate prior information about the underlying sample to further improve
  accuracy. The proposed method obtains dramatic resolution improvements over previous
  methods while retaining computational tractability.
