title: 'Active Positive Semidefinite Matrix Completion: Algorithms, Theory and Applications'
abstract: In this paper we provide simple, computationally efficient, active algorithms
  for completion of symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. Our proposed algorithms
  are based on adaptive Nyström sampling, and are allowed to actively query any element
  in the matrix, and obtain a possibly noisy estimate of the queried element. We establish
  sample complexity guarantees on the recovery of the matrix in the max-norm and in
  the process establish new theoretical results, potentially of independent interest,
  on adaptive Nyström sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms on problems
  in multi-armed bandits and kernel dimensionality reduction.
