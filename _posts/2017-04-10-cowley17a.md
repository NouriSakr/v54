title: Distance Covariance Analysis
abstract: We propose a dimensionality reduction method to identify linear projections
  that capture interactions between two or more sets of variables.   The method, distance
  covariance analysis (DCA), can detect both linear and nonlinear relationships, and
  can take dependent variables into account.  On previous testbeds and a new testbed
  that systematically assesses the ability to detect both linear and nonlinear interactions,
  DCA performs better than or comparable to existing methods, while being one of the
  fastest methods. To showcase the versatility of DCA, we also applied it to three
  different neurophysiological datasets.
