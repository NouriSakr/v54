title: Fast Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Hyperparameters on Large Datasets
abstract: Bayesian optimization has become a successful tool for hyperparameter optimization
  of machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or deep neural networks.
  Despite its success, for large datasets, training and validating a single configuration
  often takes hours, days, or even weeks, which limits the achievable performance.
  To accelerate hyperparameter optimization, we propose a generative model for the
  validation error as a function of training set size, which is learned during the
  optimization process and allows exploration of preliminary configurations on small
  subsets, by extrapolating to the full dataset.  We construct a Bayesian optimization
  procedure, dubbed FABOLAS, which models loss and training time as a function of
  dataset size and automatically trades off high information gain about the global
  optimum against computational cost. Experiments optimizing support vector machines
  and deep neural networks show that FABOLAS often finds high-quality solutions 10
  to 100 times faster than other state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods or
  the recently proposed bandit strategy Hyperband.
