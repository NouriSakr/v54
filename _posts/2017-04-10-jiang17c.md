title: Modal-set estimation with an application to clustering
abstract: 'We present a procedure that can estimate – with statistical consistency
  guarantees – any local-maxima of a density, under benign distributional conditions.
  The procedure estimates all such local maxima, or modal-sets, of any bounded shape
  or dimension, including usual point-modes. In practice, modal-sets can arise as
  dense low-dimensional structures in noisy data, and more generally serve to better
  model the rich variety of locally dense structures in data.   The procedure is then
  shown to be competitive on clustering applications, and moreover is quite stable
  to a wide range of settings of its tuning parameter. '
