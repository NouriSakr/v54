title: Nearly Instance Optimal Sample Complexity Bounds for Top-k Arm Selection
abstract: In the Best-k-Arm problem, we are given n stochastic bandit arms, each associated
  with an unknown reward distribution. We are required to identify the k arms with
  the largest means by taking as few samples as possible. In this paper, we make progress
  towards a complete characterization of the instance-wise sample complexity bounds
  for the Best-k-Arm problem. On the lower bound side, we obtain a novel complexity
  term to measure the sample complexity that every Best-k-Arm instance requires. This
  is derived by an interesting and nontrivial reduction from the Best-1-Arm problem.
  We also provide an elimination-based algorithm that matches the instance-wise lower
  bound within doubly-logarithmic factors. The sample complexity of our algorithm
  strictly dominates the state-of-the-art for Best-k-Arm (module constant factors).
